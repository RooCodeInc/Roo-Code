		content: `<task>
Please analyze this codebase and create an AGENTS.md file containing:
1. Build/lint/test commands - especially for running a single test
2. Code style guidelines including imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc.
</task>

<initialization>
  <purpose>
    Create (or update) a concise AGENTS.md file that enables immediate productivity for AI assistants.
    Focus ONLY on project-specific, non-obvious information that you had to discover by reading files.
    
    CRITICAL: Only include information that is:
    - Non-obvious (couldn't be guessed from standard practices)
    - Project-specific (not generic to the framework/language)
    - Discovered by reading files (config files, code patterns, custom utilities)
    - Essential for avoiding mistakes or following project conventions
    
    Usage notes:
    - The file you create will be given to agentic coding agents (such as yourself) that operate in this repository
    - Keep the main AGENTS.md concise - aim for about 20 lines, but use more if the project complexity requires it
    - If there's already an AGENTS.md, improve it
    - If there are Claude Code rules (in CLAUDE.md), Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules), or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include them
    - Be sure to prefix the file with: "# AGENTS.md\\n\\nThis file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this repository."
  </purpose>
  
  <todo_list_creation>
    If the update_todo_list tool is available, create a todo list with these focused analysis steps:
    
    1. Check for existing AGENTS.md files
       CRITICAL - Check these EXACT paths:
       - ./AGENTS.md (root directory)
       - ./.roo/rules-code/AGENTS.md
       - ./.roo/rules-debug/AGENTS.md
       - ./.roo/rules-ask/AGENTS.md
       - ./.roo/rules-architect/AGENTS.md
       
       If ANY of these exist:
       - Read them thoroughly
       - Analyze what's already documented
       - Plan improvements: what to add, update, or clean up
       - Focus on iterating and enhancing, not replacing
       
       Also check for other AI assistant rules:
       - .cursorrules, CLAUDE.md, .roorules
       - .cursor/rules/, .github/copilot-instructions.md
    
    2. Identify stack
       - Language, framework, build tools
       - Package manager and dependencies
    
    3. Extract commands
       - Build, test, lint, run
       - Critical directory-specific commands
    
    4. Map core architecture
       - Main components and flow
       - Key entry points
    
    5. Document critical patterns
       - Project-specific utilities (that you discovered by reading code)
       - Non-standard approaches (that differ from typical patterns)
       - Custom conventions (that aren't obvious from file structure)
    
    6. Extract code style
       - From config files only
       - Key conventions
    
    7. Testing specifics
       - Framework and run commands
       - Directory requirements
    
    8. Compile/Update AGENTS.md files
       - If files exist: Deep dive into improving them
         * Clean up outdated information
         * Add newly discovered non-obvious patterns
         * Reorganize for better clarity
         * Ensure consistency across all files
       - If creating new: Follow the non-obvious-only principle
       - Create mode-specific files in .roo/rules-*/ directories
       
    Note: If update_todo_list is not available, proceed with the analysis workflow directly without creating a todo list.
  </todo_list_creation>
</initialization>

<analysis_workflow>
  Follow the comprehensive analysis workflow to:
  
  1. **Discovery Phase**: 
     CRITICAL - First check for existing AGENTS.md files at these EXACT locations:
     - ./AGENTS.md (root)
     - ./.roo/rules-code/AGENTS.md
     - ./.roo/rules-debug/AGENTS.md
     - ./.roo/rules-ask/AGENTS.md
     - ./.roo/rules-architect/AGENTS.md
     
     If found, perform deep analysis:
     - What information is already captured?
     - What's outdated or incorrect?
     - What non-obvious patterns are missing?
     - How can the organization be improved?
     
     Also find other AI assistant rules and documentation
     
  2. **Project Identification**: Identify language, stack, and build system
  3. **Command Extraction**: Extract and verify essential commands
  4. **Architecture Mapping**: Create visual flow diagrams of core processes
  5. **Component Analysis**: Document key components and their interactions
  6. **Pattern Analysis**: Identify project-specific patterns and conventions
  7. **Code Style Extraction**: Extract formatting and naming conventions
  8. **Security & Performance**: Document critical patterns if relevant
  9. **Testing Discovery**: Understand testing setup and practices
  10. **Example Extraction**: Find real examples from the codebase
</analysis_workflow>

<output_structure>
  <main_file>
    Create or deeply improve AGENTS.md with ONLY non-obvious information:
    
    If AGENTS.md exists:
    - Perform thorough review and enhancement
    - Clean up any outdated or obvious information
    - Add newly discovered non-obvious patterns
    - Improve organization and clarity
    - Ensure it follows the non-obvious-only principle
    
    Content should include:
    - Header: "# AGENTS.md\\n\\nThis file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this repository."
    - Build/lint/test commands - ONLY if they differ from standard package.json scripts
    - Code style - ONLY project-specific rules not covered by linter configs
    - Custom utilities or patterns discovered by reading the code
    - Non-standard directory structures or file organizations
    - Project-specific conventions that violate typical practices
    - Critical gotchas that would cause errors if not followed
    
    EXCLUDE obvious information like:
    - Standard npm/yarn commands visible in package.json
    - Framework defaults (e.g., "React uses JSX")
    - Common patterns (e.g., "tests go in __tests__ folders")
    - Information derivable from file extensions or directory names
    
    Keep it concise (aim for ~20 lines, but expand as needed for complex projects).
    Include existing AI assistant rules from CLAUDE.md, Cursor rules (.cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules), or Copilot rules (.github/copilot-instructions.md).
  </main_file>
  
  <mode_specific_files>
    Create or deeply improve mode-specific AGENTS.md files.
    
    CRITICAL: For each of these paths, check if the file exists FIRST:
    - ./.roo/rules-code/AGENTS.md
    - ./.roo/rules-debug/AGENTS.md
    - ./.roo/rules-ask/AGENTS.md
    - ./.roo/rules-architect/AGENTS.md
    
    If files exist:
    - Perform deep analysis and improvement
    - Clean up redundant or obvious information
    - Add new non-obvious discoveries
    - Ensure consistency with main AGENTS.md
    - Reorganize for better clarity
    
    Example structure:
    \`\`\`
    AGENTS.md                    # General project guidance
    .roo/
    ├── rules-code/
    │   └── AGENTS.md           # Code mode specific instructions
    ├── rules-debug/
    │   └── AGENTS.md           # Debug mode specific instructions
    ├── rules-ask/
    │   └── AGENTS.md           # Ask mode specific instructions
    └── rules-architect/
        └── AGENTS.md           # Architect mode specific instructions
    \`\`\`
    
    .roo/rules-code/AGENTS.md - ONLY non-obvious coding rules discovered by reading files:
    - Custom utilities that replace standard approaches
    - Non-standard patterns unique to this project
    - Hidden dependencies or coupling between components
    - Required import orders or naming conventions not enforced by linters
    
    Example of non-obvious rules worth documenting:
    \`\`\`
    # Project Coding Rules (Non-Obvious Only)
    - Always use safeWriteJson() from src/utils/ instead of JSON.stringify for file writes (prevents corruption)
    - API retry mechanism in src/api/providers/utils/ is mandatory (not optional as it appears)
    - Database queries MUST use the query builder in packages/evals/src/db/queries/ (raw SQL will fail)
    - Provider interface in packages/types/src/ has undocumented required methods
    - Test files must be in same directory as source for vitest to work (not in separate test folder)
    \`\`\`
    
    .roo/rules-debug/AGENTS.md - ONLY non-obvious debugging discoveries:
    - Hidden log locations not mentioned in docs
    - Non-standard debugging tools or flags
    - Gotchas that cause silent failures
    - Required environment variables for debugging
    
    Example of non-obvious debug rules worth documenting:
    \`\`\`
    # Project Debug Rules (Non-Obvious Only)
    - Webview dev tools accessed via Command Palette > "Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools" (not F12)
    - IPC messages fail silently if not wrapped in try/catch in packages/ipc/src/
    - Production builds require NODE_ENV=production or certain features break without error
    - Database migrations must run from packages/evals/ directory, not root
    - Extension logs only visible in "Extension Host" output channel, not Debug Console
    \`\`\`
    
    .roo/rules-ask/AGENTS.md - ONLY non-obvious documentation context:
    - Hidden or misnamed documentation
    - Counterintuitive code organization
    - Misleading folder names or structures
    - Important context not evident from file structure
    
    Example of non-obvious documentation rules worth documenting:
    \`\`\`
    # Project Documentation Rules (Non-Obvious Only)
    - "src/" contains VSCode extension code, not source for web apps (counterintuitive)
    - Provider examples in src/api/providers/ are the canonical reference (docs are outdated)
    - UI runs in VSCode webview with restrictions (no localStorage, limited APIs)
    - Package.json scripts must be run from specific directories, not root
    - Locales in root are for extension, webview-ui/src/i18n for UI (two separate systems)
    \`\`\`
    
    .roo/rules-architect/AGENTS.md - ONLY non-obvious architectural constraints:
    - Hidden coupling between components
    - Undocumented architectural decisions
    - Non-standard patterns that must be followed
    - Performance bottlenecks discovered through investigation
    
    Example of non-obvious architecture rules worth documenting:
    \`\`\`
    # Project Architecture Rules (Non-Obvious Only)
    - Providers MUST be stateless - hidden caching layer assumes this
    - Webview and extension communicate through specific IPC channel patterns only
    - Database migrations cannot be rolled back - forward-only by design
    - React hooks required because external state libraries break webview isolation
    - Monorepo packages have circular dependency on types package (intentional)
    \`\`\`
  </mode_specific_files>
</output_structure>

<quality_criteria>
  - ONLY include non-obvious information discovered by reading files
  - Exclude anything that could be guessed from standard practices
  - Focus on gotchas, hidden requirements, and counterintuitive patterns
  - Include specific file paths when referencing custom utilities
  - Be extremely concise - if it's obvious, don't include it
  - Every line should prevent a potential mistake or confusion
  - Test: Would an experienced developer be surprised by this information?
  - If updating existing files: Ensure deep improvement, not just appending
</quality_criteria>

Remember: The goal is to create documentation that enables AI assistants to be immediately productive in this codebase, focusing on project-specific knowledge that isn't obvious from the code structure alone.`,
