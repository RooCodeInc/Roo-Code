# Mastering Kubernetes: From Basics to Production

## Introduction to Container Orchestration

In the modern software development landscape, containers have become the de facto standard for packaging and deploying applications. While Docker made containers accessible to developers worldwide, managing containers at scale presents unique challenges. This is where Kubernetes comes in â€“ a powerful container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### The Evolution of Application Deployment

To understand why Kubernetes has become so essential, let's trace the evolution of application deployment:

**Traditional Deployment Era**: In the early days, applications ran directly on physical servers. There was no isolation between applications, leading to resource allocation issues. If one application consumed too many resources, other applications would suffer. The solution was to run each application on a separate physical server, but this was expensive and didn't scale well.

**Virtualized Deployment Era**: Virtualization technology allowed multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server. Each VM is a complete machine running all the components, including its own operating system, on top of the virtualized hardware. Virtualization provides better resource utilization, easier scaling, and improved security through application isolation.

**Container Deployment Era**: Containers are similar to VMs but have relaxed isolation properties to share the Operating System (OS) among applications. They're lightweight, have their own filesystem, CPU, memory, and process space, and are decoupled from the underlying infrastructure. Containers are more portable and efficient than VMs because they don't include a full OS image.

### Why Kubernetes?

Kubernetes provides a framework to run distributed systems resiliently. It takes care of scaling and failover for your applications, provides deployment patterns, and manages the entire lifecycle of containerized applications.

Here's what Kubernetes offers:

**Service Discovery and Load Balancing**: Kubernetes can expose a container using the DNS name or using their own IP address. If traffic to a container is high, Kubernetes can load balance and distribute network traffic to ensure stable deployment.

**Storage Orchestration**: Kubernetes allows you to automatically mount a storage system of your choice, such as local storage, public cloud providers like AWS or GCP, network storage systems like NFS, iSCSI, or Gluster.

**Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks**: You can describe the desired state for your deployed containers using Kubernetes, and it will change the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. For example, you can automate Kubernetes to create new containers for your deployment, remove existing containers, and adopt all their resources to the new container.

**Automatic Bin Packing**: You provide Kubernetes with a cluster of nodes that it can use to run containerized tasks. You tell Kubernetes how much CPU and memory (RAM) each container needs, and Kubernetes fits containers onto your nodes to make the best use of your resources.

**Self-Healing**: Kubernetes restarts containers that fail, replaces containers, kills containers that don't respond to your user-defined health check, and doesn't advertise them to clients until they're ready to serve.

**Secret and Configuration Management**: Kubernetes lets you store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. You can deploy and update secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your container images and without exposing secrets in your stack configuration.

## Kubernetes Architecture

Understanding Kubernetes architecture is crucial for effective cluster management. A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.

### Control Plane Components

The control plane's components make global decisions about the cluster (for example, scheduling), as well as detecting and responding to cluster events (like starting up a new pod when a deployment's replicas field is unsatisfied).

**kube-apiserver**: The API server is a component of the Kubernetes control plane that exposes the Kubernetes API. It's the front end for the Kubernetes control plane. The main implementation of a Kubernetes API server is kube-apiserver, designed to scale horizontally by deploying more instances. You can run several instances of kube-apiserver and balance traffic between those instances.

**etcd**: Consistent and highly-available key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data. If your Kubernetes cluster uses etcd as its backing store, make sure you have a backup plan for that data. You can find in-depth information about etcd in the official documentation.

**kube-scheduler**: Control plane component that watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node and selects a node for them to run on. Factors taken into account for scheduling decisions include individual and collective resource requirements, hardware/software/policy constraints, affinity and anti-affinity specifications, data locality, inter-workload interference, and deadlines.

**kube-controller-manager**: Control plane component that runs controller processes. Logically, each controller is a separate process, but to reduce complexity, they're all compiled into a single binary and run in a single process. Some types of these controllers include:

- Node controller: Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes go down
- Job controller: Watches for Job objects that represent one-off tasks, then creates Pods to run those tasks to completion
- EndpointSlice controller: Populates EndpointSlice objects to provide a link between Services and Pods
- ServiceAccount controller: Creates default ServiceAccounts for new namespaces

**cloud-controller-manager**: A Kubernetes control plane component that embeds cloud-specific control logic. It lets you link your cluster into your cloud provider's API, and separates out the components that interact with that cloud platform from components that only interact with your cluster.

### Node Components

Node components run on every node, maintaining running pods and providing the Kubernetes runtime environment.

**kubelet**: An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a Pod. The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs provided through various mechanisms and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy. The kubelet doesn't manage containers which were not created by Kubernetes.

**kube-proxy**: A network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster, implementing part of the Kubernetes Service concept. kube-proxy maintains network rules on nodes, allowing network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster. It uses the operating system packet filtering layer if available; otherwise, kube-proxy forwards the traffic itself.

**Container Runtime**: The container runtime is the software responsible for running containers. Kubernetes supports container runtimes such as containerd, CRI-O, and any other implementation of the Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface).

## Core Kubernetes Concepts

### Pods

A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster. Pods can contain one or more containers, but it's most common to have one container per pod.

Pods are designed to support multiple cooperating processes (as containers) that form a cohesive unit of service. The containers in a Pod are automatically co-located and co-scheduled on the same physical or virtual machine in the cluster. The containers can share resources and dependencies, communicate with one another, and coordinate when and how they're terminated.

Here's an example of a simple Pod definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: nginx-pod
    labels:
        app: nginx
spec:
    containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.21
          ports:
              - containerPort: 80
          resources:
              requests:
                  memory: "64Mi"
                  cpu: "250m"
              limits:
                  memory: "128Mi"
                  cpu: "500m"
```

This Pod runs a single container using the nginx image. The resources section specifies that the container needs at least 64Mi of memory and 250 millicores of CPU, with limits of 128Mi memory and 500 millicores CPU.

### ReplicaSets

A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. However, you'll rarely create ReplicaSets directly; instead, you'll create Deployments, which manage ReplicaSets and provide declarative updates to Pods.

The main purpose of a ReplicaSet is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. It's often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
    name: nginx-replicaset
    labels:
        app: nginx
spec:
    replicas: 3
    selector:
        matchLabels:
            app: nginx
    template:
        metadata:
            labels:
                app: nginx
        spec:
            containers:
                - name: nginx
                  image: nginx:1.21
                  ports:
                      - containerPort: 80
```

### Deployments

A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate.

Deployments are ideal for stateless applications. They provide features like:

- Rollout of ReplicaSets
- Scaling up or down
- Pausing and resuming rollouts
- Rolling back to previous versions
- Clean up of older ReplicaSets

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    name: nginx-deployment
    labels:
        app: nginx
spec:
    replicas: 3
    strategy:
        type: RollingUpdate
        rollingUpdate:
            maxSurge: 1
            maxUnavailable: 1
    selector:
        matchLabels:
            app: nginx
    template:
        metadata:
            labels:
                app: nginx
        spec:
            containers:
                - name: nginx
                  image: nginx:1.21
                  ports:
                      - containerPort: 80
                  livenessProbe:
                      httpGet:
                          path: /
                          port: 80
                      initialDelaySeconds: 30
                      periodSeconds: 10
                  readinessProbe:
                      httpGet:
                          path: /
                          port: 80
                      initialDelaySeconds: 5
                      periodSeconds: 5
```

### Services

A Service is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. With Kubernetes, you don't need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.

There are several types of Services:

**ClusterIP** (default): Exposes the Service on an internal IP in the cluster. This makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster.

**NodePort**: Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port. A ClusterIP Service is automatically created. You can contact the NodePort Service from outside the cluster by requesting `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.

**LoadBalancer**: Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP Services are automatically created.

**ExternalName**: Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field by returning a CNAME record.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
    name: nginx-service
spec:
    type: LoadBalancer
    selector:
        app: nginx
    ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
          targetPort: 80
    sessionAffinity: ClientIP
    sessionAffinityConfig:
        clientIP:
            timeoutSeconds: 10800
```

### ConfigMaps and Secrets

ConfigMaps allow you to decouple configuration artifacts from image content to keep containerized applications portable. You can use ConfigMaps to store configuration data as key-value pairs or as configuration files.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
    name: app-config
data:
    database_url: "postgresql://db.example.com:5432/mydb"
    log_level: "info"
    feature_flags: |
        feature_a=true
        feature_b=false
        feature_c=true
```

Secrets are similar to ConfigMaps but are specifically intended to hold confidential data. Kubernetes automatically encrypts Secrets at rest (when stored in etcd) and in transit.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: db-credentials
type: Opaque
data:
    username: YWRtaW4= # base64 encoded 'admin'
    password: MWYyZDFlMmU2N2Rm # base64 encoded password
stringData:
    connection-string: "postgresql://admin:password@db.example.com:5432/mydb"
```

### Volumes

Kubernetes supports many types of volumes. A Pod can use any number of volume types simultaneously. At its core, a volume is a directory, possibly with some data in it, accessible to the containers in a Pod.

Common volume types include:

**emptyDir**: An empty directory that gets created when a Pod is assigned to a node and exists as long as that Pod is running on that node. When a Pod is removed from a node, the data in emptyDir is deleted permanently.

**hostPath**: Mounts a file or directory from the host node's filesystem into your Pod. This should be used with caution as it poses security risks.

**persistentVolumeClaim**: Used to mount a PersistentVolume into a Pod. PersistentVolumes are a way for users to "claim" durable storage without knowing the details of the particular cloud environment.

**configMap**: Provides a way to inject configuration data into Pods.

**secret**: Used to pass sensitive information to Pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
    name: database-pvc
spec:
    accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
    storageClassName: fast-ssd
    resources:
        requests:
            storage: 10Gi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: database-pod
spec:
    containers:
        - name: postgres
          image: postgres:14
          volumeMounts:
              - name: database-storage
                mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
          env:
              - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
                valueFrom:
                    secretKeyRef:
                        name: db-credentials
                        key: password
    volumes:
        - name: database-storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
              claimName: database-pvc
```

## Advanced Kubernetes Patterns

### StatefulSets

While Deployments are ideal for stateless applications, StatefulSets are designed for stateful applications that require stable network identities, stable persistent storage, and ordered deployment and scaling.

StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following:

- Stable, unique network identifiers
- Stable, persistent storage
- Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling
- Ordered, automated rolling updates

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
    name: mongodb-service
    labels:
        app: mongodb
spec:
    ports:
        - port: 27017
          targetPort: 27017
    clusterIP: None
    selector:
        app: mongodb
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
    name: mongodb
spec:
    serviceName: mongodb-service
    replicas: 3
    selector:
        matchLabels:
            app: mongodb
    template:
        metadata:
            labels:
                app: mongodb
        spec:
            containers:
                - name: mongodb
                  image: mongo:5.0
                  ports:
                      - containerPort: 27017
                  volumeMounts:
                      - name: mongodb-data
                        mountPath: /data/db
                  env:
                      - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME
                        valueFrom:
                            secretKeyRef:
                                name: mongodb-secret
                                key: username
                      - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD
                        valueFrom:
                            secretKeyRef:
                                name: mongodb-secret
                                key: password
    volumeClaimTemplates:
        - metadata:
              name: mongodb-data
          spec:
              accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
              storageClassName: fast-ssd
              resources:
                  requests:
                      storage: 20Gi
```

### DaemonSets

A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) nodes run a copy of a Pod. As nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added to them. As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage collected.

Typical uses of a DaemonSet are:

- Running a cluster storage daemon on every node
- Running a logs collection daemon on every node
- Running a node monitoring daemon on every node

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
    name: fluentd
    labels:
        app: fluentd
spec:
    selector:
        matchLabels:
            app: fluentd
    template:
        metadata:
            labels:
                app: fluentd
        spec:
            containers:
                - name: fluentd
                  image: fluent/fluentd:v1.14
                  resources:
                      limits:
                          memory: 200Mi
                      requests:
                          cpu: 100m
                          memory: 200Mi
                  volumeMounts:
                      - name: varlog
                        mountPath: /var/log
                      - name: varlibdockercontainers
                        mountPath: /var/lib/docker/containers
                        readOnly: true
            volumes:
                - name: varlog
                  hostPath:
                      path: /var/log
                - name: varlibdockercontainers
                  hostPath:
                      path: /var/lib/docker/containers
```

### Jobs and CronJobs

A Job creates one or more Pods and ensures that a specified number of them successfully terminate. As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the Job itself is complete.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
    name: data-migration
spec:
    template:
        spec:
            containers:
                - name: migrator
                  image: myapp/data-migrator:v1
                  command: ["./migrate"]
                  env:
                      - name: DATABASE_URL
                        valueFrom:
                            secretKeyRef:
                                name: db-credentials
                                key: connection-string
            restartPolicy: Never
    backoffLimit: 4
    completions: 1
    parallelism: 1
```

A CronJob creates Jobs on a repeating schedule. One CronJob object is like one line of a crontab file. It runs a job periodically on a given schedule, written in Cron format.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
    name: database-backup
spec:
    schedule: "0 2 * * *" # Run at 2 AM every day
    jobTemplate:
        spec:
            template:
                spec:
                    containers:
                        - name: backup
                          image: myapp/backup-tool:v1
                          command: ["./backup.sh"]
                          env:
                              - name: BACKUP_LOCATION
                                value: "s3://my-backups/database"
                              - name: DATABASE_URL
                                valueFrom:
                                    secretKeyRef:
                                        name: db-credentials
                                        key: connection-string
                    restartPolicy: OnFailure
    successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 3
    failedJobsHistoryLimit: 1
```
