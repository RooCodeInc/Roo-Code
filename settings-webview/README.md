# Settings Webview Migration

This folder contains a new implementation of the Roo Code settings panel using React, TypeScript, Vite, Vitest, React Router, and Fluent UI. The goal is to gradually migrate all settings from the current implementation in `@webview-ui/src/components/settings/SettingsView.tsx` to this new implementation.

## Architecture

- **React**: UI library
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **Vite**: Fast development and building
- **Vitest**: Testing framework
- **React Router**: Navigation
- **Fluent UI**: UI component library

## Development Process

1. Set up the project structure âœ…
2. Create a basic UI with a two-column layout (1/3 for navigation, 2/3 for content)
3. Implement communication with the extension
4. Migrate settings sections one by one
5. Run both implementations in parallel until migration is complete
6. Switch over to the new implementation
