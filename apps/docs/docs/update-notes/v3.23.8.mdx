# Roo Code 3.23.8 Release Notes (2025-07-13)

This release adds command workflow controls and improves the user interface.

## Command Denylist

We've added the ability to automatically reject unwanted commands in your workflows (thanks hannesrudolph!) ([#5614](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5614)):

- **Always Reject**: Mark commands as "always reject" to prevent accidental execution
- **Time Saving**: No need to manually reject the same commands repeatedly  
- **Workflow Control**: Complements existing auto-approval functionality with "always reject" option

This gives you better control over command execution in automated workflows.

## QOL Improvements

* **Codebase Indexing Toggle**: Added enable/disable checkbox for codebase indexing in settings with state persistence across sessions (thanks daniel-lxs, elasticdotventures!) ([#5599](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5599))
* **Chat Interface**: Improved chat layout with better organization and increased task history visibility (3 tasks instead of 2)
* **Command Messaging**: Clearer messaging when command prefixes are denied - users now see that denial is due to their settings rather than automatic system behavior
* **History Navigation**: Added "View all history" link to the HistoryPreview component for easier access to full task history when the history tab is hidden

## Misc Improvements

* **Type Definitions**: Updated internal type definitions for improved compatibility and development experience
