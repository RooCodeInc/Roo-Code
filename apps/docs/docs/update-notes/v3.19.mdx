# Roo Code 3.19 Release Notes (2025-06-09)

This release series focuses on streamlining the user interface with intelligent context condensing enabled by default, improved mode organization, enhanced file protection, experimental multi-file reading capabilities, and numerous quality-of-life improvements.

---

## Provider Updates

*   **OpenRouter Latency**: Replaced explicit caching with implicit caching for Gemini models via OpenRouter to significantly reduce latency ([#4488](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4488))

*   **Bedrock**: Improved model information detection for custom Bedrock ARNs, ensuring better compatibility (thanks adamhill!)

---

## QOL Improvements

*   **Fix reading PDF, DOCX, and IPYNB files in [`read_file`](/advanced-usage/available-tools/read-file) tool**: Ensures reliable reading of these file types (thanks samhvw8!)
*   **History Preview**: Buttons in the history preview now fade when there is no interaction, providing a cleaner UI (thanks samhvw8!) ([#4458](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4458))

---

## Bug Fixes

*   **Mermaid Diagrams**: Fixed Content Security Policy (CSP) errors for Mermaid diagrams by implementing an enhanced bundling strategy (thanks KJ7LNW!)
*   **LiteLLM Provider**: Fixed a bug that caused an error when the LiteLLM provider URL contained a trailing slash (thanks kcwhite!) ([#4275](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4275))
*   **Copy Button**: Fixed an issue with the copy button logic (thanks samhvw8!) ([#4458](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4458))
*   **MCP Server Management**: Fixed a bug where the MCP server list would not update correctly after changes (like adding or deleting servers) without a full extension reload. The manual refresh button and automatic refresh on configuration changes now work reliably. (thanks taylorwilsdon!) ([#4267](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4267))
*   **McpHub Sidebar Focus**: We've fixed an issue where the McpHub sidebar would unexpectedly grab focus, providing a smoother navigation experience. ([#4548](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4548))
*   **Checkpoints**: We've disabled the checkpoint functionality when nested git repositories are detected to prevent conflicts. ([#4509](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4509))

---

## Documentation Updates

*   **Concurrent File Reads**: Clarified that the default concurrent file read limit is 15, not the maximum (thanks olearycrew!) ([#4474](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4474))

---

## Misc Improvements

*   **OpenAI Compatible Embedder**: Added a new embedder for codebase indexing that is compatible with the OpenAI API, expanding options for local and custom embedding models (thanks SannidhyaSah!)
*   **Enforce [`codebase_search`](/advanced-usage/available-tools/codebase-search) as primary tool**: Roo Code now always uses codebase_search as the first step for code understanding tasks, improving accuracy and consistency (thanks hannesrudolph!)
*   **Build Scripts**: Removed unnecessary `npx` usage from some npm scripts (thanks user202729!) ([#4003](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4003))
*   **Storybook**: We've removed unused Storybook components and dependencies to reduce the bundle size. ([#4517](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4517))
*   **ESLint**: We've added a `data-testid` ESLint rule to improve our testing standards (thanks elianiva!). ([#4505](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4505))
*   **Dependencies**: We've updated our development dependencies, including eslint, knip, @types/node, i18next, fast-xml-parser, and @google/genai.
*   **CI**: We've improved our CI infrastructure with GitHub Actions and Blacksmith runner migrations. ([#4472](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4472), [#4507](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4507))
*   **Gemini**: We've added the ability to control the thinking budget for Gemini models via Requesty (thanks dtrugman!). ([#4486](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4486))

Thank you to all our contributors for making Roo Code better with each release!
