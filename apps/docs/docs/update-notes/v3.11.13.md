# Roo Code 3.11.13 Release Notes (2025-04-11)

This release includes several terminal enhancements, improved diff error display, file context tracking, and various fixes.

---

## New Terminal Settings (thanks KJ7LNW!)

Six new configurable settings were added to improve terminal reliability:

- **Terminal command delay setting** - Adds a small pause after running commands to fix output capture issues in some terminals. Useful if Roo has trouble seeing command results.
- **PowerShell counter workaround setting** - Helps PowerShell run identical commands multiple times without failing. Turn this on if Roo struggles with repeated commands.
- **Clear ZSH EOL mark setting** - Prevents ZSH from adding special characters that can confuse Roo when reading terminal output.
- **Oh My Zsh integration setting** - Makes Roo work better with the popular Oh My Zsh shell customization framework. (experimental)
- **Powerlevel10k integration setting** - Improves compatibility with the Powerlevel10k ZSH theme. (experimental)
- **ZDOTDIR handling setting** - Helps Roo work with custom ZSH configurations without interfering with your personal settings. (experimental)

For detailed information about these settings and shell integration troubleshooting, see [Terminal Shell Integration](/features/shell-integration).
