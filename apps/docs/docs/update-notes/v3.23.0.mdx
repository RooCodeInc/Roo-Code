# Roo Code 3.23.0 Release Notes (2025-07-09)

This release graduates codebase indexing to a stable feature, introduces a powerful new todo list for managing complex tasks, and a whole lot of bug fixes!

## Codebase Indexing: Always On, Always Ready

Codebase indexing has graduated from an experimental feature and is now a core part of Roo Code, available directly from your chat input. You can now manage your index by clicking the database icon in the bottom-right corner of the chat box. Once configured, the indexer runs automatically in the background, ensuring Roo always has an up-to-date semantic understanding of your project. To get started, see the [Codebase Indexing quick start guide](/features/codebase-indexing#quick-start-guide).

## New: Task Todo List

This release introduces a new todo list feature to help you keep track of complex tasks. Roo Code will now display a checklist of steps for your task, ensuring that no step is missed. You can view and manage the todo list directly in the chat interface.

## QOL Improvements

- **Simplified Prompt History**: Navigate your prompt history using only the up and down arrow keys when the cursor is at the start of the input field ([#5467](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5467))
- **API Provider Search**: You can now search and filter the list of API providers in the settings (thanks GOODBOY008!) ([#5278](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5278))
<img src="/img/v3.23.0/v3.23.0-1.png" alt="API Provider Search interface showing search and filter functionality" width="400" />
- **Copy Prompt Button**: Adds a 'Copy Prompt' button to the task actions (thanks Juice10, vultrnerd!) ([#5392](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5392))

- **Chat UI**: Fixes several UI inconsistencies and layout shifting issues in the chat view to create a more stable and polished user experience (thanks seedlord!) ([#5237](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5237))
- **Model Search Dropdown**: Fixed an issue where the model search input was pre-filled with the current model, now starts with a clean search field (thanks kevinvandijk!) ([#5449](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5449))
- **Chat Interface Polish**: Added proper spacing to the camera icon and made placeholder text non-selectable, preventing accidental highlighting (thanks MuriloFP!) ([#5477](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5477))
- **Clean Custom Mode Deletion**: Deleting a custom mode now also deletes its corresponding `.roo/rules-{mode}` folder ([#5317](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5317))
- **File Listing Performance**: Optimized file listing in large repositories when workspace file listing is disabled, resolving slow initial requests (thanks daniel-lxs, jcaplan!) ([#5421](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5421))
- **`insert_content` Tool**: The `insert_content` tool can now create new files when inserting content at the beginning or end of a file (thanks Ruakij, KJ7LNW!) ([#4382](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4382))

## Bug Fixes

- **Chat Focus**: Prevents the chat from losing focus during automated workflows, stopping user input from being accidentally redirected to files being edited by Roo (thanks ColbySerpa!) ([#5349](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5349))
- **Architect Mode File Restrictions**: Fixed an issue where Architect mode was not properly enforcing file restrictions (thanks shanemmattner!) ([#5447](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5447))
- **Slash Command Descriptions**: Standardizes mode descriptions in slash commands for a more consistent user experience ([#5388](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5388))
- **Follow-up Question Timer**: Fixed an issue where the auto-approval timer for follow-up questions would continue even after a user responded (thanks liwilliam2021!) ([#5368](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5368))
- **TypeScript Watch Path**: Fixes an issue where TypeScript compiler errors in watch mode would not correctly link back to the source file (thanks bbenshalom, KJ7LNW!) ([#5155](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5155))
- **Completion Sound**: Prevents annoying repetitive completion sounds when reopening completed tasks, making the completion notification more meaningful and less intrusive (thanks SannidhyaSah!) ([#5249](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5249))
- **New Task Streaming**: Fixed an issue where creating a new task with large instructions would cause the UI to appear frozen ([#5432](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5432))
- **MCP Image Resources**: Fixed MCP image resource handling to support servers that don't use standard data URI format, allowing users to successfully process images from a wider range of MCP servers (thanks s97712!) ([#5254](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5254))
- **`create_mode` Instructions**: The `create_mode` instructions now include the `description` field ([#5433](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5433))
- **OpenRouter**: Fixes an issue where the number of reserved tokens for OpenRouter models was displayed incorrectly (thanks shariqriazz!) ([#5240](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5240))
