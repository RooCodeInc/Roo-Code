This patch release addresses potential stability issues.

## General and QOL Improvements

- **Context Mentions:** Reverted recent changes to context mention handling as a precaution against potential performance issues or crashes reported by some users. We are investigating the root cause and will reintroduce the improvements once stability is confirmed.
