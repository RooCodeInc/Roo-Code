# Roo Code 3.3.19 Release Notes (2025-02-12)

This release includes bug fixes and improvements related to file writes, UI themes, custom instructions, and checkpoints.

---

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed a bug where aborting during file writes would not revert the changes.
- Ensured dialog backgrounds honor the VS Code theme.
- Made it possible to clear default custom instructions for built-in modes.
- Added a help button linking to the documentation site.
- Switched checkpoints logic to use a shadow git repository to avoid issues with hot reloads and polluting existing repositories. (thanks Cline!)
