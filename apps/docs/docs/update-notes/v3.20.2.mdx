# Roo Code 3.20.2 Release Notes (2025-06-13)

This release introduces security fixes, UI improvements, and codebase refactoring for enhanced security, user experience, and maintainability.

## Bug Fixes

*   **Security**:
    *   Force `tar-fs >=2.1.3` to fix a security vulnerability ([#4629](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4629))
    *   Limit `search_files` to workspace for improved security ([#4642](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4642))
*   **UI**:
    *   Sync `BatchDiffApproval` styling with `BatchFilePermission` for UI consistency (thanks samhvw8!) ([#4640](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4640))
    *   Add max height constraint to MCP execution response for better UX (thanks samhvw8!) ([#4644](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4644))
    *   Prevent MCP 'installed' label from being squeezed (thanks daniel-lxs!) ([#4649](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4649))
*   **Bedrock**: Reapply reasoning for bedrock with fix (thanks daniel-lxs!) ([#4645](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4645))

## Misc Improvements

*   **Context Condensing**: Allow a lower context condensing threshold (thanks SECKainersdorfer!) ([#4634](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4634))
*   **Code Quality**:
    *   Avoid type system duplication for cleaner codebase (thanks EamonNerbonne!) ([#4596](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4596))
    *   Improve PR Reviewer and Issue Fixer Rules for better guidance and targeted fixes ([#4651](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4651), [#4652](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4652))
*   **Unbound**: Add cache breakpoints for custom vertex models on Unbound (thanks pugazhendhi-m!) ([#4585](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4585))
*   **Docs**: Add docs extractor mode for comprehensive documentation extraction ([#4621](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4621))
