# Roo Code 3.23.14 Release Notes (2025-07-17)

This release improves internal workflows and fixes API task logging.

## Misc Improvements

* **Internal Workflow Simplification**: Removed unnecessary orchestrator modes and unified all GitHub operations to use the GitHub CLI instead of MCP tools, making internal development processes more efficient ([#5832](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5832))

## Bug Fixes

* **API Task Logging**: Fixed an issue where API-initiated tasks would attempt to write logs to workspace directories that might not exist. Logs now write to the system's temporary directory instead ([#5833](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5833))
