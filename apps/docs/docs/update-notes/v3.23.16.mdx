# Roo Code 3.23.16 Release Notes (2025-07-19)

This release improves performance for large codebases and enhances development workflows.

## Performance Improvements

* **Code Indexing**: Added memory-safe batch limiting to prevent overflow when scanning large codebases (thanks daniel-lxs!) ([#5891](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5891))
* **API Rate Limiting**: Implemented global rate limiting with exponential backoff for OpenAI-compatible embeddings, preventing API overload and improving reliability (thanks daniel-lxs!) ([#5854](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5854))

## QOL Improvements

* **Development Environment**: Fixed Docker port conflicts for evaluation services by using ports 5433 (PostgreSQL) and 6380 (Redis) instead of default ports (thanks roomote!) ([#5909](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5909))
* **Release Engineering**: Enhanced release notes generation to include issue numbers and reporters for better attribution (thanks roomote!) ([#5940](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5940))

## Misc Improvements

* **Repository Statistics**: Excluded non-English translation files from GitHub language statistics for more accurate codebase representation (thanks roomote!) ([#5943](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5943))
