# Roo Code 3.19.1 Release Notes (2025-05-31)

This patch release delivers critical fixes and experimental features to enhance your development experience, including multi-file reading capabilities, improved MCP server integration, and enterprise security enhancements.

---

## Multi-File Reading (Experimental)
We've introduced an experimental feature for handling large codebases more efficiently:

- **Batch File Processing**: Read up to 100 files in a single operation for comprehensive code analysis
- **Performance Control**: Adjustable concurrent file read limits to optimize for your system
- **Smart Permission Management**: Streamlined approval process for multi-file operations
- **Efficiency Boost**: Dramatically reduces the time needed to analyze multiple related files

This experimental feature transforms how Roo Code understands and works with your entire codebase at once (thanks samhvw8!).

## Enterprise-Ready VPC Endpoint Support
We've added crucial enterprise security features for [AWS Bedrock](/providers/bedrock) users:

- **Secure Corporate Access**: Configure custom VPC endpoints to keep all LLM transactions within your firewall
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple checkbox and text field to enable VPC endpoint usage
- **Compliance Ready**: Meet your organization's security policies while using powerful AI models
- **Flexible Control**: Toggle VPC endpoints on/off as needed with settings persistence

Enterprise customers can now use Roo Code with AWS Bedrock while maintaining complete network security (thanks kcwhite!). See the [AWS Bedrock configuration guide](/providers/bedrock#configuration-in-roo-code) for setup instructions.
