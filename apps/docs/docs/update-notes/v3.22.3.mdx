# Roo Code 3.22.3 Release Notes (2025-06-27)

This release fixes compatibility issues with custom mode files to ensure a smooth experience for users upgrading from earlier versions.

## Bug Fixes

* **Custom Modes**: Fixed JSON backwards compatibility for `.roomodes` files, ensuring older custom modes work correctly after updating from previous versions (thanks daniel-lxs, domc66, africa1207!) ([#5199](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5199))
