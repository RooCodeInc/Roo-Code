# Roo Code 2.1.14 Release Notes

This release includes fixes and improvements for diff editing.

---

## Improvements & Fixes

- Fixed a bug where diffs were not being applied correctly.
- Attempted using Aider's unified diff prompt for potentially better results.
- Added logic to automatically reject `write_to_file` commands that result in truncated output when diff editing is enabled.
