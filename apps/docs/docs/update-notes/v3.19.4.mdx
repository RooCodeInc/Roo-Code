# Roo Code 3.19.4 Release Notes (2025-06-05)

This patch release delivers critical memory leak fixes, new Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 model support, improved infrastructure for evals, and several quality-of-life and workflow enhancements.

---

## Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 Model Support
We've added support for the newly released Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 model, giving you access to the latest advancements from Google (thanks daniel-lxs and shariqriazz!). This model is available in the [Gemini](/providers/gemini), [Vertex](/providers/vertex), and [OpenRouter](/providers/openrouter) providers.

## Major Memory Leak Fixes
We've resolved multiple memory leaks across the extension, resulting in improved stability and performance:
- **ChatView**: Fixed leaks from unmanaged async operations and setTimeouts (thanks kiwina!)
- **WorkspaceTracker**: FileSystemWatcher and other disposables are now properly cleaned up (thanks kiwina!)
- **RooTips**: setTimeout is now cleared to prevent state updates on unmounted components (thanks kiwina!)
- **RooIgnoreController**: FileSystemWatcher leak resolved by ensuring Task.dispose() is always called (thanks kiwina!)
- **Clipboard**: useCopyToClipboard now clears setTimeout to avoid memory leaks (thanks kiwina!)
- **ClineProvider**: Instance cleanup improved to prevent lingering resources (thanks xyOz-dev!)

## Bug Fixes

*   **Mermaid Diagrams**: Fixed Content Security Policy (CSP) errors for Mermaid diagrams by implementing an enhanced bundling strategy (thanks KJ7LNW!)

---

## Misc Improvements

*   **OpenAI Compatible Embedder**: Added a new embedder for codebase indexing that is compatible with the OpenAI API, expanding options for local and custom embedding models (thanks SannidhyaSah!)
*   **Enforce [`codebase_search`](/advanced-usage/available-tools/codebase-search) as primary tool**: Roo Code now always uses codebase_search as the first step for code understanding tasks, improving accuracy and consistency (thanks hannesrudolph!)
*   **Improved Docker setup for evals**: Dockerfile and docker-compose updated for better isolation, real-time monitoring, and streamlined configuration
*   **Move evals into pnpm workspace, switch from SQLite to Postgres**: Evals are now managed in a pnpm workspace and use PostgreSQL for improved scalability
*   **Refactor [MCP](/features/mcp/overview) to use getDefaultEnvironment for stdio client transport**: Simplifies MCP client setup and improves maintainability (thanks samhvw8!)
*   **Get rid of "partial" component in names referencing not necessarily partial messages**: Improves code clarity (thanks wkordalski!)
