# Roo Code 3.20.0 Release Notes (2025-06-12)

This release introduces the experimental Marketplace for extensions and modes, concurrent file edits and reads, and numerous other improvements and bug fixes.

## MCP & Mode Marketplace (experimental)

We've introduced an experimental [Marketplace](/features/marketplace) for discovering and installing community-contributed extensions and modes. This feature allows you to:
- Browse and search for new modes and MCP servers
- Install items at project or global scope
- Manage installations directly from the Marketplace view

**To enable:** Open Roo Code settings (gear icon) → Experimental Settings → Enable "Marketplace"

(thanks Smartsheet-JB-Brown, elianiva, monkeyDluffy6017, NamesMT, daniel-lxs, and more!) ([#4538](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4538), [#4604](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4604))

## Concurrent Edits (aka multi-file)(experimental)

You can now perform edits across multiple files at once, dramatically speeding up refactoring and multi-file changes. Instead of approving each file edit individually, you can review and approve all changes at once through a unified batch approval interface. Check out our [concurrent file edits documentation](/features/experimental/concurrent-file-edits) for more details.

**To enable:** Open Roo Code settings (gear icon) → Experimental Settings → Enable "Enable multi-file edits"

(thanks samhvw8!) ([#4608](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4608))

## Concurrent Reads (aka multi-file)

The setting for concurrent reads has been moved to the context settings, with a default of 5. This feature allows Roo to read multiple files from your workspace in a single step, significantly improving efficiency when working on tasks that require context from several files. Learn more in our [concurrent file reads documentation](/features/concurrent-file-reads).

## Prompt History

Navigate your prompt history with a terminal-like experience using the arrow keys. This feature makes it easy to reuse and refine previous prompts, whether from your current conversation or past tasks. See our [keyboard shortcuts documentation](/features/keyboard-shortcuts#command-line-style-prompt-history-navigation) for usage details.
