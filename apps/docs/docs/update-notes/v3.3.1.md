# Roo Code 3.3.1 Release Notes

This patch release includes important fixes for terminal management and mode switching.

## Bug Fixes

- Resolved an issue where the terminal management system created unnecessary new terminals. (thanks evan-fannin!)
- Fixed a bug where the saved API provider for a mode wasn't selected correctly after a mode switch command.
