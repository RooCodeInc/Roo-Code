# Roo Code 3.23.5 Release Notes (2025-07-09)

This release fixes file handling issues and improves account accessibility.

## Bug Fixes

* **Error Messages**: Fixed display of raw translation keys in embedding provider error messages - now shows properly localized messages (thanks daniel-lxs!) ([#5535](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5535))
* **File Opening**: Fixed file opening functionality for files and folders with special characters like brackets in their names (thanks vivekfyi, nielpattin!) ([#5504](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5504))

## QOL Improvements

* **Account Access**: Account features are now more accessible - the account tab is visible in the main navigation instead of being hidden in the overflow menu ([#5534](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5534))
