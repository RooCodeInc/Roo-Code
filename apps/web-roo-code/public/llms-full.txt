# Roo Code

> Your AI Software Engineering Team in the IDE and the Cloud.

Roo Code is an open-source, AI-powered coding agent built by Roo Code, Inc. It works both as a VS Code extension for interactive, local development and as autonomous cloud agents that handle tasks like planning, coding, PR review, and PR fixing. Unlike simple autocompletion tools, Roo Code reads and writes across multiple files, executes terminal commands, opens browsers for testing, and adapts to your workflow with role-specific modes.

## Roo Code VS Code Extension

The Roo Code VS Code Extension is a free, open-source AI coding assistant that runs locally in Visual Studio Code (and any VS Code fork, including Cursor). It provides deep, project-wide context and agentic capabilities far beyond autocomplete.

Product page: https://roocode.com/extension
Install: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline

### Core Capabilities

- **Multi-file editing**: Reads, refactors, and updates multiple files at once for holistic code changes.
- **Terminal command execution**: Runs commands like npm install, test suites, build tools -- always with your permission.
- **Browser integration**: Can open a web browser for integration testing when approved.
- **Deep project context**: Understands your entire codebase structure, not just the current file.
- **Permission-based**: Every file change and command execution requires your approval (or can be set to auto-approve).

### Role-Specific Modes

Modes keep AI models focused on a given task and limit their access to tools relevant to their role, keeping the context window clearer and avoiding surprises. Built-in modes include:

- **Architect**: Plans complex changes without making code modifications. Ideal for designing system architecture and breaking down complex problems.
- **Code**: Implements, refactors, and optimizes code. The primary mode for writing and modifying code.
- **Ask**: Explains functionality and program behavior. Best for understanding concepts and analyzing existing code.
- **Debug**: Diagnoses issues, traces failures, and proposes targeted, reliable fixes.
- **Test**: Creates and improves tests without changing the actual functionality.

You can also create custom modes with their own system prompts, tool permissions, and file access restrictions. Modes are smart enough to ask to switch to another mode when stepping outside their responsibilities.

### Model-Agnostic Design

Roo Code does not lock you into a single AI provider. It works with dozens of models and providers, including:

- OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4, o1, o3)
- Anthropic (Claude 4 Sonnet, Claude 4 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- Google (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.0 Flash)
- DeepSeek
- Mistral
- xAI (Grok)
- Qwen
- Kimi / Moonshot
- Local LLMs via Ollama
- OpenRouter (access to hundreds of models)
- Amazon Bedrock
- And many more via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

You can bring your own API key from any provider or use the Roo Code Router for at-cost access to top models.

### Configurability

- Highly tweakable settings to fit your workflow
- Keyboard shortcut support
- .rooignore files to exclude sensitive files from AI context
- Custom system prompts per mode
- Auto-approval settings for trusted operations
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) for extending capabilities

### Privacy and Security

- Code never leaves your machine unless you connect to an external AI API
- You control exactly what is sent to the AI model
- Works with offline/local models for full privacy
- Open source -- fully auditable
- The extension does not use your data for training

### Language Support

Roo Code supports a wide range of programming languages including Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, and many more. Since it leverages the AI model's understanding, most languages with model support will work.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What exactly is Roo Code?
Roo Code is an open-source, AI-powered coding assistant that runs in VS Code. It goes beyond simple autocompletion by reading and writing across multiple files, executing commands, and adapting to your workflow -- like having a whole dev team right inside your editor.

### How does Roo Code differ from Copilot, Cursor, or Windsurf?
Roo Code is open-source and fully customizable, letting you integrate any AI model you choose (OpenAI, Anthropic, local LLMs, etc.). It is built for multi-file edits, so it can read, refactor, and update multiple files at once. Its agentic abilities go beyond typical AI autocomplete, enabling it to run tests, open a browser, and handle deeper tasks. And you are always in control: Roo Code is permission-based, meaning you approve any file changes or command executions.

### Is Roo Code really free?
Yes. Roo Code is completely free and open-source. You only pay for the AI model usage if you use a paid API (like OpenAI). If you choose free or self-hosted models, there is no cost at all.

### Will my code stay private?
Yes. Because Roo Code is an extension in your local VS Code, your code never leaves your machine unless you connect to an external AI API. Even then, you control exactly what is sent to the AI model. You can use .rooignore to exclude sensitive files, and you can run Roo Code with offline/local models for full privacy.

### Which AI models does Roo Code support?
Roo Code is fully model-agnostic. It supports OpenAI models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, o1), Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, local LLMs via Ollama, and many more. You can connect any model that follows the supported API patterns.

### Does Roo Code support my programming language?
Likely yes. Roo Code supports a wide range of languages -- Python, Java, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Rust, and many more. Since it leverages the AI model's understanding, new or lesser-known languages may also work depending on model support.

### How do I install and get started?
Install Roo Code from the VS Code Marketplace, add your AI keys in the extension settings, open the Roo panel, and start typing commands in plain English.

### Can it handle large, enterprise-scale projects?
Absolutely. Roo Code uses efficient strategies like partial-file analysis, summarization, and user-specified context to handle large codebases. Enterprises appreciate the on-prem or self-hosted model option for compliance and security needs.

### Is it safe for enterprise use?
Yes. You can self-host AI models or use your own trusted provider. All file changes and commands go through permission gating. Because Roo Code is fully open-source, it is auditable.

### Can Roo Code run commands and tests automatically?
Yes. Roo Code can execute terminal commands like npm install, run your test suites, and open a web browser for integration testing -- always optional and fully permission-based.

### Can I contribute to Roo Code?
