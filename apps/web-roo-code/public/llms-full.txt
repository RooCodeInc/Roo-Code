## What is Roo Code

Roo Code is an AI-powered software development platform that puts an entire AI dev team at your disposal. It goes beyond simple code autocompletion by reading and writing across multiple files, executing commands, running tests, and adapting to your workflow.

Roo Code has two form factors:

1. **Roo Code VS Code Extension** -- for individual, interactive work. Run Roo directly in VS Code (or any fork, including Cursor), stay close to the code, and control everything. Ideal for real-time debugging, quick iteration, and hands-on development.

2. **Roo Code Cloud** -- for team work with autonomous agents. Create your agent team in the cloud, give them access to GitHub, and start delegating tasks from the web, Slack, Linear, and more. Ideal for parallelizing execution, kicking off projects, and looping in the rest of your team.

The VS Code extension is completely free and open source. Roo Code Cloud offers free and paid tiers.

### Key Principles

- **Model-agnostic by design**: "The best model in the world" changes every other week. Roo Code works with dozens of models from frontier to open weight. Use the curated Roo Code Router selection at cost, or bring your own API key from any provider.
- **Custom modes for focused work**: Specialized modes -- Architect, Code, Ask, Debug, Test, Orchestrator -- stay on task and deliver. They know when to hand off work to other modes. You can create your own modes or download from the marketplace.
- **Permission-based control**: You approve every file change and command execution. Configure granular auto-approval rules to make Roo as autonomous as you want as you build confidence.
- **Open source and auditable**: Community-driven with no throttling or surprises about what is happening behind the scenes. SOC 2 Type II compliant.

## Roo Code VS Code Extension

The Roo Code VS Code extension is the #1 most-installed open-source AI coding extension. It is free, open source, and available on the VS Code Marketplace.

**Website**: https://roocode.com/extension
**Install**: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline
**Source code**: https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code

### Key Features

- **Specialized modes**: Architect (plans complex changes without making changes), Code (implements, refactors, and optimizes), Ask (explains functionality and program behavior), Debug (diagnoses issues, traces failures, and proposes targeted fixes), Test (creates and improves tests without changing actual functionality), Orchestrator (coordinates large tasks across other agents). Users can also create custom modes.
- **Model-agnostic**: Supports OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4, o1), Anthropic Claude (Claude 3.5 Sonnet and later), Google Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Mistral, Qwen, Kimi, Moonshot, local LLMs via Ollama, and any provider via OpenRouter. Dozens of providers supported.
- **Multi-file editing**: Reads, refactors, and updates multiple files at once for holistic code changes.
- **Agentic command execution**: Runs terminal commands like npm install, executes test suites, and can open a web browser for integration testing -- all with your approval.
- **Granular auto-approval**: Control each action individually. Make Roo as autonomous as you want as you build confidence.
- **Large task coordination**: Orchestrator mode handles large tasks by coordinating subtasks for other agents, running for hours and delivering.
- **Performant with large codebases**: Configurable integrated semantic search for quicker retrieval in large codebases.
- **Highly customizable**: Fine-tune settings for inference context, model properties, slash commands, and more. Most settings can be global or serialized in your repository.
- **Open source**: Community-driven and fully auditable.
- **Secure and private by design**: Client-only architecture means no code leaves your machine unless you say so. SOC 2 Type II compliant. Use .rooignore to exclude sensitive files. Run with offline/local models for full privacy.

### Supported Languages

Roo Code supports a wide range of programming languages including Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and many more. Since it leverages AI model capabilities, new or lesser-known languages may also work depending on model support.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Roo Code supports the Model Context Protocol, allowing it to connect to external tools and data sources via MCP servers. This provides maximum flexibility in extending Roo Code's capabilities beyond built-in features.

## Roo Code Cloud

Roo Code Cloud lets you create an AI agent team that runs autonomously in isolated cloud containers. Agents can be triggered from the web UI, Slack, Linear, or GitHub.

**Website**: https://roocode.com/cloud
**Sign up**: https://app.roocode.com/sign-up

### How It Works

1. **Connect your GitHub account**: Pick which repos the agents can work with in their isolated containers and choose what model you want to power each of them.
2. **Set up your agent team**: Choose the roles you want filled -- Explainer, Planner, Coder, PR Reviewer, PR Fixer. They know how to act in each situation and stay on-task.
3. **Start giving them tasks**: Describe what you want from the web UI, get the Reviewer automatically reviewing PRs, and much more.

### Cloud Features

- **Autonomous Cloud Agents**: Delegate work to specialized agents that run 24/7.
- **Model Agnostic**: Bring your own keys or use the Roo Code Router with access to all top models with no markup.
- **GitHub PR Reviews**: Agents can automatically review pull requests, provide feedback, and push fixes directly to your repository.
- **Slack Integration**: Start tasks, get updates, and collaborate with agents directly from Slack channels.
- **Linear Integration**: Assign issues to Roo Code directly from Linear. Get PRs back without switching tools.
- **Team Collaboration**: Manage your team and their access to tasks and resources, with centralized billing and configuration.
- **Usage Analytics**: Detailed token analytics to help optimize costs and usage across your team.
- **Task History**: Access all tasks from anywhere, from the cloud and the extension.
- **Task Sharing**: Share tasks with friends and coworkers and let them follow your work in real-time.

## Roo Code for Slack

**Website**: https://roocode.com/slack

Mention @Roomote in any Slack channel to explain code, plan features, or ship a PR -- all without leaving the conversation.

### Key Capabilities

- **Discussion to PR**: Your team discusses a feature in Slack. @Roomote turns the discussion into a plan, then builds it.
- **Thread-aware**: @Roomote reads the full thread before responding. It understands context from the conversation.
- **Chain agents**: Start with a Planner to spec it out, then call the Coder to build it. Multi-step workflows in one Slack thread.
- **Open to all**: Anyone on your team can ask @Roomote to fix bugs, build features, or investigate issues.
- **Safe by design**: Agents never touch main/master directly. They produce branches and PRs. You approve.

### Slack Workflow

1. Turn the discussion into a plan -- your team discusses a feature, then summon the Planner agent.
2. Refine the plan in the thread -- the team reviews, suggests changes, asks questions. Mention @Roomote to refine.
3. Build the plan -- hand it off to the Coder agent to implement.
4. Review and ship -- the Coder creates a branch and opens a PR. The team reviews and ships.

### Setup

Slack integration requires a Team plan. Connect via Roo Code Cloud settings, authorize the app, and add @Roomote to channels.

---

## Roo Code for Linear

**Website**: https://roocode.com/linear

Assign development work to @Roo Code directly from Linear. Get PRs back without switching tools.

### Key Capabilities

- **Work where you already work**: Assign development work directly from Linear. No new tools to learn.
- **Progress is visible**: Watch progress in real-time. Roo Code posts updates as comments.
- **Mention for refinement**: Comment "@Roo Code also add dark mode support" and the agent picks up where it left off.
- **Full traceability**: Every PR links back to the originating issue. Your audit trail stays clean.
- **Organization-level setup**: Connect once, use everywhere.
- **Safe by design**: Agents produce branches and PRs. You review and approve before merge.

### Setup

Linear integration requires a Team plan. Connect GitHub, authorize Linear via OAuth, map your Linear project to a repo, then assign or mention @Roo Code.

---

## PR Reviewer Agent

**Website**: https://roocode.com/reviewer

AI-powered code reviews that catch what other AI tools and most humans miss.

### How It Differs

- **Bring your own key, get uncompromised reviews**: Most AI review tools use fixed pricing, which means they skimp on tokens to protect margins. With Roo, you bring your own API key. Reviews focus on real problems like business logic, security vulnerabilities, and architectural issues.
- **Advanced reasoning**: Leverages state-of-the-art reasoning models with sophisticated workflows: diff analysis, context gathering, impact mapping, and contract validation. Catches subtle bugs that surface-level tools miss.
- **Repository-aware, not snippet-aware**: Analyzes your entire codebase context -- dependency graphs, code ownership, team conventions, and historical patterns. Understands how changes interact with existing systems.

### How It Works

1. Connect your GitHub repository and configure which branches and pull requests should be reviewed.
2. Provide your AI provider API key and set review preferences, custom rules, and quality standards.
3. Every pull request gets detailed GitHub comments in minutes highlighting issues and suggesting improvements.

---

## PR Fixer Agent

**Website**: https://roocode.com/pr-fixer

Automatically apply high-quality fixes to pull requests based on review comments.

### How It Differs

- **Comment-history aware**: Understands the entire conversation on the PR -- previous reviews, replies, follow-ups -- and uses that context to produce accurate fixes.
- **Bring your own key**: Use preferred models at full strength. Prompts are optimized for depth, not cost-cutting.
- **Repository- and diff-aware**: Analyzes the full repo context and latest diff to ensure fixes align with project conventions and pass checks.

### How It Works

1. Connect your GitHub repositories.
2. Invoke from a PR comment (e.g., "@roomote: fix these review comments"). The agent reads the entire comment history and latest diffs.
3. The agent proposes targeted changes and pushes concise commits you can review and merge quickly.
