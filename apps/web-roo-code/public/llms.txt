# Roo Code

> Roo Code is an AI-powered software development platform with two core products: a free, open-source VS Code extension for interactive AI-assisted coding, and Roo Code Cloud for autonomous AI agents that work in the background.

Roo Code is built by Roo Code, Inc. The VS Code extension is the #1 most-installed open-source AI coding extension on the VS Code Marketplace. Roo Code Cloud extends this with autonomous agents that can be triggered from the web, Slack, Linear, or GitHub.

## Core Products

- [Roo Code VS Code Extension](https://roocode.com/extension): Free, open-source AI coding assistant. Model-agnostic, supports multi-file editing, custom modes, agentic command execution, and permission-based control. Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, local LLMs, and dozens more.
- [Roo Code Cloud](https://roocode.com/cloud): Autonomous AI agents -- Planner, Coder, Explainer, PR Reviewer, PR Fixer -- that run 24/7 in isolated cloud containers, triggered from the web UI, Slack, Linear, or GitHub.
- [Roo Code Enterprise](https://roocode.com/enterprise): Enterprise control-plane with centralized management, SAML/SCIM, usage analytics, cost controls, model allow-lists, and audit trails.
