# Roo Code

> Your AI Software Engineering Team in the IDE and the Cloud.

Roo Code is an open-source, AI-powered coding agent that works as a VS Code extension and as autonomous cloud agents. It goes beyond simple autocompletion -- reading and writing across multiple files, executing terminal commands, reviewing PRs, and adapting to your workflow.
