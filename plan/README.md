# Silent Mode Implementation Plans

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for implementing Silent Mode in Roo Code. Silent Mode allows Roo to work in the background without interrupting the user's current work by opening files or switching tabs.

## 📋 Planning Documents

### [🎯 Implementation Plan](./silent-mode-implementation.md)

**Primary document** containing the complete implementation roadmap

- Requirements summary and architecture overview
- Detailed implementation steps for each component
- File modification lists and code examples
- Implementation sequence and phases
- Technical considerations and success metrics

### [🏗️ Technical Design](./silent-mode-technical-design.md)

**Detailed technical specifications** for all system components

- System architecture diagrams
- Core class definitions and interfaces
- File operation integration patterns
- State management and error handling
- Performance considerations and security measures

### [🎨 User Experience Design](./silent-mode-user-experience.md)

**Complete UX specifications** for user-facing features

- User personas and journey maps
- Interface mockups and interaction patterns
- Settings integration and notification design
- Accessibility considerations and error states
- User onboarding and feedback collection

### [🧪 Testing Strategy](./silent-mode-testing-strategy.md)

**Comprehensive testing approach** for quality assurance

- Unit, integration, and end-to-end test plans
- Performance testing and benchmarks
- User acceptance testing scenarios
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Quality gates and metrics

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Read the [Implementation Plan](./silent-mode-implementation.md)** to understand the overall approach
2. **Review the [Technical Design](./silent-mode-technical-design.md)** for detailed specifications
3. **Check the [UX Design](./silent-mode-user-experience.md)** for user interface requirements
4. **Plan testing using the [Testing Strategy](./silent-mode-testing-strategy.md)**

## 📊 Implementation Status

Based on the TODO list:

- [ ] **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**

    - [ ] Add silentMode setting to global settings
    - [ ] Implement silent mode detection logic

- [ ] **Phase 2: Background Operations**

    - [ ] Modify DiffViewProvider for silent operations
    - [ ] Create tool wrapper system for silent mode

- [ ] **Phase 3: Completion & Review**

    - [ ] Implement completion notification system
    - [ ] Create diff review interface

- [ ] **Phase 4: Polish & Commands**
    - [ ] Add toggle command and final integration

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✨ What Silent Mode Provides

- **Zero Interruption**: Work continues uninterrupted while Roo helps in background
- **Full Control**: User decides when to review and apply changes
- **Context Preservation**: Current files and tabs remain exactly as they were
- **Clear Review Process**: Easy-to-use interface for reviewing all changes

### 🔧 How It Works

1. **Smart Detection**: Automatically activates when files aren't being actively edited
2. **Background Processing**: All file operations happen in memory buffers
3. **Change Tracking**: Every modification is tracked for later review
4. **Notification System**: Non-intrusive alerts when tasks complete
5. **Review Interface**: Comprehensive diff viewer for approving changes

## 📁 File Structure Impact

The implementation will add these new components:

```
src/core/silent-mode/
├── SilentModeController.ts     # Main orchestration
├── SilentModeDetector.ts       # Activity detection
├── ChangeTracker.ts            # Change management
├── BufferManager.ts            # Memory operations
└── SilentToolWrapper.ts        # Tool integration

webview-ui/src/components/silent-mode/
├── SilentModeReview.tsx        # Review interface
├── SilentModeSettings.tsx      # Settings UI
└── SilentModeNotification.tsx  # Notifications
```

## 🔄 Integration Points

Silent Mode integrates with existing systems:

- **Settings System**: New `silentMode` configuration option
- **Tool System**: Wrapper for `writeToFileTool`, `applyDiffTool`, etc.
- **DiffViewProvider**: Extended to support background operations
- **Notification System**: Enhanced for task completion alerts
- **Command System**: New toggle command for quick activation

## 💡 Design Principles

1. **Non-Intrusive**: Never interrupt the user's current work
2. **Transparent**: Clear indication of what's happening in background
3. **Controllable**: User has full control over when to engage
4. **Reliable**: Graceful fallback to interactive mode when needed
5. **Performant**: Minimal impact on system resources

## 🔍 Quality Assurance

- **95% Unit Test Coverage**: All core logic thoroughly tested
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Windows, macOS, and Linux compatibility
- **Performance Benchmarks**: <5% overhead, <50MB memory usage
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Backward Compatibility**: Zero impact when feature is disabled
