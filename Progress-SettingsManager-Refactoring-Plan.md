- [x] Implement `SettingsManager.ts` with all required functionality
- [x] Add proper JSDoc comments
- [x] Add error handling

### Step 2: Create Unit Tests for SettingsManager ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Create test directory `src/core/settings/__tests__/`
- [x] Implement `SettingsManager.test.ts`
- [x] Run tests to verify functionality

### Step 3: Modify ClineProvider to Use SettingsManager ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Add SettingsManager import and property
- [x] Replace settings methods with calls to SettingsManager
- [x] Update webview message handling
- [x] Update API configuration handling

### Step 4: Update Files That Interact with ClineProvider ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Update `src/core/webview/ClineProvider.ts` to use SettingsManager
- [x] Fix EventEmitter mock in ClineProvider tests
- [x] Check `src/core/Cline.ts` (no changes needed)
- [x] Check `src/exports/index.ts` (no changes needed)
- [x] Check `src/services/mcp/McpServerManager.ts` (minimal usage, left as-is for now)
- [x] Check `src/services/mcp/McpHub.ts` (no changes needed)

### Step 5: Testing ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Run unit tests (all 910 tests passing)
- [x] Run specific tests for SettingsManager (30 tests passing)
- [x] Run specific tests for ClineProvider (41 tests passing)

### Issues and Fixes

1. **EventEmitter Mock Issue in ClineProvider Tests**
    - **Issue**: After implementing the SettingsManager class and updating ClineProvider to use it, the ClineProvider tests started failing. The error indicated that the EventEmitter class was not properly mocked in the ClineProvider tests.
    - **Root Cause**: The SettingsManager class uses vscode.EventEmitter, but the mock implementation in the ClineProvider tests didn't include the EventEmitter class.
    - **Fix**: Updated the vscode mock in ClineProvider.test.ts to include the EventEmitter class with the same mock implementation used in SettingsManager.test.ts:
        ```javascript
        EventEmitter: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => ({
          event: jest.fn(),
          fire: jest.fn(),
        })),
        ```
    - **Result**: All tests now pass successfully.

### Phase 1 Results

Phase 1 of the refactoring has been completed successfully. We've created the SettingsManager class and modified ClineProvider to use it. However, we've identified some issues with the current implementation:

1. **Code Size**: The refactoring added 769 lines to SettingsManager.ts but only changed about 56 lines in ClineProvider.ts, which doesn't significantly reduce the size of ClineProvider.
2. **Delegation Pattern**: ClineProvider still maintains wrapper methods that delegate to SettingsManager, which means the method signatures are still there, even if the implementation is now just a one-liner.
3. **Duplicate Type Definitions**: The SecretKey and GlobalStateKey types are defined in both files.

These issues will be addressed in Phase 2 of the refactoring.

## Phase 2: Complete Refactoring (In Progress)

In Phase 2, we'll focus on eliminating the delegation pattern, removing duplicate code, and further reducing the size of ClineProvider.ts.

### Step 1: Remove Duplicate Type Definitions ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Remove the `SecretKey` and `GlobalStateKey` type definitions from ClineProvider.ts
- [x] Import these types from SettingsManager.ts instead
- [x] Update any references to these types in ClineProvider.ts

### Step 2: Remove Delegation Methods ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Identify all methods in ClineProvider that simply delegate to SettingsManager
- [x] Update all internal callers within ClineProvider to use SettingsManager directly
- [x] For methods that have additional logic beyond delegation, extract that logic
- [x] Add helper methods to maintain compatibility with existing code
- [x] Make helper methods public to ensure they're accessible to other classes like Cline.ts
- [x] Add updateTaskHistory method to support Cline.ts functionality
- [x] Run tests to verify all functionality works correctly

### Step 3: Extract Model Fetching Logic ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Create a new `ModelManager` class in `src/core/models/ModelManager.ts`
- [x] Move all model fetching methods from ClineProvider to ModelManager
- [x] Update ClineProvider to use ModelManager
- [x] Create unit tests for ModelManager in `src/core/models/__tests__/ModelManager.test.ts`
- [x] Ensure all tests pass with the new implementation

### Step 3.1: Fix ModelManager Tests ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Identify and fix issues with ModelManager tests
- [x] Update test assertions to properly check for model properties
- [x] Verify all tests pass with the updated implementation

### Step 4: Extract Task History Management ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Create a new `TaskHistoryManager` class in `src/core/tasks/TaskHistoryManager.ts`
- [x] Move all task history related methods from ClineProvider to TaskHistoryManager
- [x] Update ClineProvider to use TaskHistoryManager
- [x] Create unit tests for TaskHistoryManager in `src/core/tasks/__tests__/TaskHistoryManager.test.ts`
- [x] Ensure all tests pass with the new implementation

### Step 4.1: Fix TaskHistoryManager Tests ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Identify and fix issues with TaskHistoryManager tests
- [x] Fix fs/promises import in TaskHistoryManager.ts
- [x] Update fs/promises mock to include unlink, rm, and rmdir functions
- [x] Fix parameter shadowing in TaskHistoryManager.test.ts
- [x] Verify all tests pass with the updated implementation

### Step 5: Refactor Webview Message Handling ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Create a new `WebviewMessageHandlers` class in `src/core/webview/WebviewMessageHandlers.ts`
- [x] Group related message types together into separate handler methods
- [x] Create unit tests for the `WebviewMessageHandlers` class
- [x] Integrate the `WebviewMessageHandlers` class into `ClineProvider.ts`
- [x] Update property visibility in `ClineProvider` to match `ClineProviderInterface`
- [x] Fix syntax error in ClineProvider.ts by adding a catch block to the try statement in setWebviewMessageListener

### Step 6: Update Tests ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Create tests for WebviewMessageHandlers
- [x] Run all tests to ensure they pass with the new implementation
- [x] Commit changes to version control

### Step 7: Update Documentation ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Update `cline_docs/settings.md` to reflect the new architecture
- [x] Document the new classes and their responsibilities
- [x] Update any other relevant documentation

## Current Status

Both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the refactoring are now complete! We've successfully implemented all steps:

### Phase 1:

- Created the SettingsManager class
- Added unit tests for SettingsManager
- Modified ClineProvider to use SettingsManager
- Updated files that interact with ClineProvider
- Verified all tests pass

### Phase 2:

- Removed duplicate type definitions
- Removed delegation methods
- Extracted model fetching logic into a dedicated ModelManager class
- Extracted task history management into a dedicated TaskHistoryManager class
- Refactored webview message handling into WebviewMessageHandlers class
- Created ClineProviderInterface for clear component interactions
- Updated tests to ensure they pass with the new implementation
- Updated documentation to reflect the new architecture

The codebase is now more modular and easier to maintain, with clear separation of concerns between settings management, model management, task history management, and webview message handling.

## Results and Benefits

The refactoring has achieved the following benefits:

1. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Each class has a clear, focused responsibility
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller, more focused components are easier to understand and modify
3. **Enhanced Testability**: Isolated components with clear responsibilities are easier to test
4. **Simplified Extension**: Future additions will be more straightforward with a cleaner architecture

All 939 tests are passing, confirming that the refactoring has not broken any existing functionality.

## Issues and Fixes in Phase 2

1. **TaskHistoryManager Import Issue**
    - **Issue**: After implementing the TaskHistoryManager class, the tests were failing with an error: `TypeError: fs.unlink is not a function`.
    - **Root Cause**: The fs/promises module was imported incorrectly in TaskHistoryManager.ts, and the mock implementation in fs/promises.ts didn't include the unlink, rm, and rmdir functions.
    - **Fix**:
        - Updated the import statement in TaskHistoryManager.ts from `import fs from "fs/promises"` to `import * as fs from "fs/promises"`.
        - Added mock implementations for unlink, rm, and rmdir functions in src/**mocks**/fs/promises.ts.
        - Fixed parameter shadowing in TaskHistoryManager.test.ts where a parameter named `path` was shadowing the imported `path` module.
    - **Result**: All tests now pass successfully.

## Next Steps: Phase 3

Despite the successful completion of Phases 1 and 2, the ClineProvider.ts file still remains large (approximately 2000 lines). To further improve the codebase, we'll proceed with Phase 3: Advanced Component Extraction.

### Phase 3: Advanced Component Extraction (In Progress)

Phase 3 will focus on further reducing the size and complexity of ClineProvider by extracting more specialized components and implementing design patterns to improve maintainability.

#### Step 1: Extract WebviewManager ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Create a new `WebviewManager` class in `src/core/webview/WebviewManager.ts`
- [x] Move all webview-related methods from ClineProvider to WebviewManager:
    - `getHtmlContent`
    - `getHMRHtmlContent`
    - `resolveWebviewView`
    - `postMessageToWebview`
- [x] Update ClineProvider to use WebviewManager
- [x] Create unit tests for WebviewManager
- [x] Update ClineProvider tests to work with WebviewManager

The WebviewManager implementation has successfully extracted the following functionality from ClineProvider:

- HTML content generation for both production and development (HMR) modes
- Webview resolution and initialization
- Message posting to the webview
- Event listeners for visibility changes and configuration changes

This extraction has reduced the size of ClineProvider.ts by removing approximately 200 lines of code and improved separation of concerns by isolating webview-specific functionality.

##### Issues and Fixes

1. **Test Compatibility Issues**
    - **Issue**: After implementing the WebviewManager class and updating ClineProvider to use it, the ClineProvider tests started failing. The tests are expecting certain methods to be called directly on ClineProvider, but now those methods are being called on WebviewManager instead.
    - **Root Cause**: The tests were written with the assumption that ClineProvider would handle webview-related functionality directly, but now that functionality has been moved to WebviewManager.
    - **Fix**: Updated the WebviewManager mock in ClineProvider.test.ts to properly handle the webview's onDidReceiveMessage method and to forward postMessageToWebview calls to the webview's postMessage method. This ensures that the tests can still verify that messages are being sent to the webview correctly.
    - **Result**: All tests now pass successfully.

#### Step 2: Implement Command Pattern for Webview Messages ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Create a new directory `src/core/webview/commands/`
- [x] Create an interface for command handlers in `WebviewCommandHandler.ts`
- [x] Create command handler implementations for each message type category:
    - [x] SettingsCommandHandler
    - [x] TaskCommandHandler
    - [x] TaskHistoryCommandHandler
    - [x] ModelCommandHandler
    - [x] ApiConfigCommandHandler
    - [x] McpCommandHandler
    - [x] MiscCommandHandler
    - [x] PromptCommandHandler
    - [x] CustomModeCommandHandler
    - [x] WebviewInitCommandHandler
- [x] Create a command registry to manage handlers in `WebviewCommandRegistry.ts`
- [x] Update ClineProvider to use the command registry
- [x] Create unit tests for the command pattern implementation

The Command Pattern implementation has successfully extracted the message handling logic from ClineProvider into separate command handler classes. This has significantly reduced the size and complexity of ClineProvider.ts by removing the large switch statement in the setWebviewMessageListener method. Each command handler now has a clear, focused responsibility, making the code more maintainable and easier to test.

#### Step 3: Extract SystemPromptGenerator (Planned)

- [ ] Create a new file `src/core/prompts/SystemPromptGenerator.ts`
- [ ] Move the system prompt generation logic from ClineProvider to SystemPromptGenerator
- [ ] Update ClineProvider to use SystemPromptGenerator
- [ ] Create unit tests for SystemPromptGenerator

#### Step 4: Extract BrowserManager (Planned)

- [ ] Create a new file `src/core/browser/BrowserManager.ts`
- [ ] Move browser-related methods and logic from ClineProvider to BrowserManager
- [ ] Update ClineProvider to use BrowserManager
- [ ] Create unit tests for BrowserManager

#### Step 5: Implement Service Locator Pattern (Planned)

- [ ] Create a new file `src/core/ServiceLocator.ts`
- [ ] Implement the service locator pattern
- [ ] Update ClineProvider to use the service locator
- [ ] Create unit tests for ServiceLocator

#### Step 6: Create ClineProviderFactory (Planned)

- [ ] Create a new file `src/core/webview/ClineProviderFactory.ts`
- [ ] Implement the factory pattern
- [ ] Update extension.ts to use the factory
- [ ] Create unit tests for ClineProviderFactory

#### Step 7: Update Tests (Planned)

- [ ] Create tests for all new classes
- [ ] Update existing tests to reflect the new structure
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass with the new implementation

#### Step 8: Update Documentation (Planned)

- [ ] Update `cline_docs/settings.md` to reflect the new architecture
- [ ] Document the new classes and their responsibilities
- [ ] Update any other relevant documentation

## Implementation Strategy

To minimize risk and ensure a smooth transition, we'll implement Phase 3 in the following order:

1. Extract WebviewManager first, as this will immediately reduce the size of ClineProvider ✅
2. Implement the Command Pattern for webview messages next, as this will further reduce complexity ✅
3. Extract SystemPromptGenerator and BrowserManager
4. Implement the Service Locator and ClineProviderFactory last, as these affect the overall architecture

Each step will be completed with full test coverage before moving to the next step.
