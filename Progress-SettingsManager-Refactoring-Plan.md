# Progress: SettingsManager Refactoring

This document tracks the progress of implementing the SettingsManager refactoring plan as outlined in [SettingsManager-Refactoring-Plan.md](./SettingsManager-Refactoring-Plan.md).

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create the SettingsManager Class ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Create directory structure `src/core/settings/`
- [x] Implement `SettingsManager.ts` with all required functionality
- [x] Add proper JSDoc comments
- [x] Add error handling

### Step 2: Create Unit Tests for SettingsManager ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Create test directory `src/core/settings/__tests__/`
- [x] Implement `SettingsManager.test.ts`
- [x] Run tests to verify functionality

### Step 3: Modify ClineProvider to Use SettingsManager ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Add SettingsManager import and property
- [x] Replace settings methods with calls to SettingsManager
- [x] Update webview message handling
- [x] Update API configuration handling

### Step 4: Update Files That Interact with ClineProvider ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Update `src/core/webview/ClineProvider.ts` to use SettingsManager
- [x] Fix EventEmitter mock in ClineProvider tests
- [x] Check `src/core/Cline.ts` (no changes needed)
- [x] Check `src/exports/index.ts` (no changes needed)
- [x] Check `src/services/mcp/McpServerManager.ts` (minimal usage, left as-is for now)
- [x] Check `src/services/mcp/McpHub.ts` (no changes needed)

### Step 5: Testing ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Run unit tests (all 910 tests passing)
- [x] Run specific tests for SettingsManager (30 tests passing)
- [x] Run specific tests for ClineProvider (41 tests passing)

## Issues and Fixes

1. **EventEmitter Mock Issue in ClineProvider Tests**
    - **Issue**: After implementing the SettingsManager class and updating ClineProvider to use it, the ClineProvider tests started failing. The error indicated that the EventEmitter class was not properly mocked in the ClineProvider tests.
    - **Root Cause**: The SettingsManager class uses vscode.EventEmitter, but the mock implementation in the ClineProvider tests didn't include the EventEmitter class.
    - **Fix**: Updated the vscode mock in ClineProvider.test.ts to include the EventEmitter class with the same mock implementation used in SettingsManager.test.ts:
        ```javascript
        EventEmitter: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => ({
          event: jest.fn(),
          fire: jest.fn(),
        })),
        ```
    - **Result**: All tests now pass successfully.

## Current Status

All steps completed! We've successfully:

1. Created the SettingsManager class with all required functionality
2. Implemented comprehensive unit tests for the SettingsManager
3. Modified ClineProvider to use SettingsManager for all settings-related operations
4. Fixed the EventEmitter mock in ClineProvider tests to ensure compatibility with SettingsManager
5. Checked other files that interact with ClineProvider and determined that:
    - Cline.ts and McpHub.ts don't directly use context.globalState or context.secrets
    - McpServerManager.ts has minimal usage of context.globalState (only two places) and can be left as-is for now
6. Run all tests to verify that our changes haven't broken anything:
    - All 910 tests are passing (with 4 pending, which is expected)
    - Specific tests for SettingsManager (30 tests) are passing
    - Specific tests for ClineProvider (41 tests) are passing

The refactoring is now complete and ready for review.

### Notes for Future Improvements

- Consider refactoring McpServerManager.ts to use SettingsManager instead of directly accessing context.globalState. This would require either:
    1. Passing a SettingsManager instance to the static methods
    2. Creating static methods in SettingsManager to access global state
    3. Refactoring McpServerManager to be a non-static class that can hold a SettingsManager instance
