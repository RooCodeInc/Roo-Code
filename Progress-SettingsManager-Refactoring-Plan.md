# Progress: SettingsManager Refactoring

This document tracks the progress of implementing the SettingsManager refactoring plan as outlined in [SettingsManager-Refactoring-Plan.md](./SettingsManager-Refactoring-Plan.md).

## Phase 1: Initial Extraction (Completed)

### Step 1: Create the SettingsManager Class ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Create directory structure `src/core/settings/`
- [x] Implement `SettingsManager.ts` with all required functionality
- [x] Add proper JSDoc comments
- [x] Add error handling

### Step 2: Create Unit Tests for SettingsManager ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Create test directory `src/core/settings/__tests__/`
- [x] Implement `SettingsManager.test.ts`
- [x] Run tests to verify functionality

### Step 3: Modify ClineProvider to Use SettingsManager ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Add SettingsManager import and property
- [x] Replace settings methods with calls to SettingsManager
- [x] Update webview message handling
- [x] Update API configuration handling

### Step 4: Update Files That Interact with ClineProvider ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Update `src/core/webview/ClineProvider.ts` to use SettingsManager
- [x] Fix EventEmitter mock in ClineProvider tests
- [x] Check `src/core/Cline.ts` (no changes needed)
- [x] Check `src/exports/index.ts` (no changes needed)
- [x] Check `src/services/mcp/McpServerManager.ts` (minimal usage, left as-is for now)
- [x] Check `src/services/mcp/McpHub.ts` (no changes needed)

### Step 5: Testing ✅ (Completed)

- [x] Run unit tests (all 910 tests passing)
- [x] Run specific tests for SettingsManager (30 tests passing)
- [x] Run specific tests for ClineProvider (41 tests passing)

### Issues and Fixes

1. **EventEmitter Mock Issue in ClineProvider Tests**
    - **Issue**: After implementing the SettingsManager class and updating ClineProvider to use it, the ClineProvider tests started failing. The error indicated that the EventEmitter class was not properly mocked in the ClineProvider tests.
    - **Root Cause**: The SettingsManager class uses vscode.EventEmitter, but the mock implementation in the ClineProvider tests didn't include the EventEmitter class.
    - **Fix**: Updated the vscode mock in ClineProvider.test.ts to include the EventEmitter class with the same mock implementation used in SettingsManager.test.ts:
        ```javascript
        EventEmitter: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => ({
          event: jest.fn(),
          fire: jest.fn(),
        })),
        ```
    - **Result**: All tests now pass successfully.

### Phase 1 Results

Phase 1 of the refactoring has been completed successfully. We've created the SettingsManager class and modified ClineProvider to use it. However, we've identified some issues with the current implementation:

1. **Code Size**: The refactoring added 769 lines to SettingsManager.ts but only changed about 56 lines in ClineProvider.ts, which doesn't significantly reduce the size of ClineProvider.
2. **Delegation Pattern**: ClineProvider still maintains wrapper methods that delegate to SettingsManager, which means the method signatures are still there, even if the implementation is now just a one-liner.
3. **Duplicate Type Definitions**: The SecretKey and GlobalStateKey types are defined in both files.

These issues will be addressed in Phase 2 of the refactoring.

## Phase 2: Complete Refactoring (Planned)

In Phase 2, we'll focus on eliminating the delegation pattern, removing duplicate code, and further reducing the size of ClineProvider.ts.

### Step 1: Remove Duplicate Type Definitions ⬜ (Planned)

- [ ] Remove the `SecretKey` and `GlobalStateKey` type definitions from ClineProvider.ts
- [ ] Import these types from SettingsManager.ts instead
- [ ] Update any references to these types in ClineProvider.ts

### Step 2: Remove Delegation Methods ⬜ (Planned)

- [ ] Identify all methods in ClineProvider that simply delegate to SettingsManager
- [ ] Update all internal callers within ClineProvider to use SettingsManager directly
- [ ] For methods that have additional logic beyond delegation, extract that logic
- [ ] Update the `setWebviewMessageListener` method to use SettingsManager directly for all settings-related messages

### Step 3: Extract Model Fetching Logic ⬜ (Planned)

- [ ] Create a new `ModelManager` class in `src/core/models/ModelManager.ts`
- [ ] Move all model fetching methods from ClineProvider to ModelManager
- [ ] Update ClineProvider to use ModelManager

### Step 4: Extract Task History Management ⬜ (Planned)

- [ ] Create a new `TaskHistoryManager` class in `src/core/tasks/TaskHistoryManager.ts`
- [ ] Move all task history related methods from ClineProvider to TaskHistoryManager
- [ ] Update ClineProvider to use TaskHistoryManager

### Step 5: Refactor Webview Message Handling ⬜ (Planned)

- [ ] Break down the large `setWebviewMessageListener` method into smaller, more focused methods
- [ ] Group related message types together
- [ ] Create separate handler methods for each group of message types

### Step 6: Update Tests ⬜ (Planned)

- [ ] Update ClineProvider tests to reflect the new structure
- [ ] Add tests for the new classes (ModelManager, TaskHistoryManager)
- [ ] Ensure all existing tests pass with the new implementation

### Step 7: Update Documentation ⬜ (Planned)

- [ ] Update `cline_docs/settings.md` to reflect the new architecture
- [ ] Document the new classes and their responsibilities
- [ ] Update any other relevant documentation

## Current Status

Phase 1 is complete, and we're ready to begin Phase 2. The plan for Phase 2 has been outlined in the [SettingsManager-Refactoring-Plan.md](./SettingsManager-Refactoring-Plan.md) document.

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementing Step 1 of Phase 2: Remove Duplicate Type Definitions
2. Proceed with the remaining steps of Phase 2 in order
3. Continuously test and validate the changes to ensure the refactoring doesn't break existing functionality
