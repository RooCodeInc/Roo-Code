"@roo-code/types": patch

The change in this package involves the addition of a new setting called showBrowserForTextMode to the global settings schema in the file packages/types/src/global-settings.ts. This setting is defined as an optional boolean field, and it has been added to the GLOBAL_SETTINGS_KEYS array. This update likely introduces a new configuration option related to browser visibility in text mode for the application or extension.
