I introduced a new method `processCarriageReturns` in `TerminalProcess.ts` to process carriage returns in terminal output. This method splits the output into lines, handles each line with `\r` by retaining only the content after the last carriage return, and preserves escape sequences to avoid breaking terminal formatting. The method is called within `getUnretrievedOutput` to ensure output is processed before being displayed. Additionally, I added comprehensive test cases in `TerminalProcess.test.ts` under a new `describe("processCarriageReturns", ...)` block to validate various scenarios, including basic progress bars, multiple lines, and ANSI escape sequences.

Key implementation details:

- The solution carefully handles special characters and escape sequences to maintain terminal integrity.
- Tradeoff: Slightly increased processing overhead for outputs with carriage returns, but this is negligible compared to the improved user experience.
- Iâ€™d like reviewers to pay close attention to the handling of edge cases in `processCarriageReturns` (e.g., lines ending with `\r` or mixed content with escape sequences) to ensure no unintended side effects.
