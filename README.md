# Roo-Cline Research

An experimental fork of Cline, an autonomous coding agent, focused on research and advanced AI development capabilities.

## Update and Migration Guide

### Cloning the Original Repository

```bash
# Clone the original Roo-Cline repository
git clone https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Cline.git
cd Roo-Cline
```

### Applying the Researcher Patch

```bash
# If you have the researcher.patch file
git apply researcher.patch

# Or manually apply changes:
# 1. Rename the project
# 2. Update package.json
# 3. Modify README.md
```

### Migration Steps

1. Backup your existing project
2. Clone the original repository
3. Apply the researcher patch
4. Verify and test the changes
5. Resolve any conflicts manually

## Patch Details

The `researcher.patch` includes:
- Renaming from "roo-cline" to "roo-cline-research"
- Updated package configuration
- Modified extension identifiers
- Research-focused README updates

### Potential Migration Challenges

- Compatibility with existing extensions
- Potential breaking changes
- Configuration differences

## Troubleshooting

```bash
# If patch fails, try:
git apply --reject researcher.patch

# Manually resolve .rej files
# Use diff tools to merge changes
```

## Research Objectives

This project aims to explore and extend the boundaries of autonomous coding agents through:
- Advanced AI integration
- Experimental configuration mechanisms
- Automation feature research
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool development

## Key Research Features

- Autonomous code generation and modification
- Advanced AI model integration
- Experimental tool creation capabilities
- Comprehensive context management
- Adaptive AI coding strategies

## Experimental Capabilities

- Auto-approval mechanisms for commands and operations
- Custom per-project instruction support (`.clinerules`)
- Side-by-side operation with original Cline
- Comprehensive unit test coverage
- Innovative sound effect and interaction design
- Advanced model support (OpenRouter, Gemini, etc.)
- Image-based interaction research
- Diff-based editing strategies
- MCP server management

## Disclaimer

**Experimental Research Project**
