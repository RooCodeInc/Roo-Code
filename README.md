# Riko ðŸš€

*A fork of the Roo codebase enhanced with integrated, AI-powered, spec-driven development features.*

**Project Status:** In Development

## Vision

**Riko** extends the powerful and intuitive Roo application with a native feature for **spec-driven development**. The goal is to provide developers with a systematic way to plan, design, and map out implementation tasks directly within their primary workflow. By integrating this structured process, Riko aims to improve planning, enhance collaboration, and increase the quality and maintainability of software projects.

## Core Features

* **Spec Management Dashboard**: A centralized view to create, manage, and track the status of all your feature specifications.
* **Multi-Phase Spec Editor**: A guided, three-phase editor for defining **Requirements**, creating a **Technical Design**, and breaking down the work into **Implementation Tasks**.
* **Seamless Roo Integration**: Built to feel like a natural part of the Roo application, Riko uses the existing Svelte component library and Tailwind CSS design system for a consistent UX.
* **AI-Assisted Workflow**: Designed to work with AI assistants to help generate, refine, and implement specs, streamlining the development process.
