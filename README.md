## Riko: Spec-Driven Development for Roo Code

An extension for the Roo codebase that integrates a native, AI-powered, **spec-driven development** workflow.

**Project Status:** In Development

---

**Riko** enhances the Roo application by embedding a systematic process for planning, designing, and implementing software features. By transforming ideas into clear specifications *before* writing code, Riko helps developers and teams build the right thing, correctly.

It formalizes the development lifecycle into three distinct phases:
* **Requirements**: Define what needs to be built with clear, testable user stories.
* **Design**: Create a comprehensive technical blueprint for the feature.
* **Tasks**: Break down the design into an actionable, step-by-step implementation plan.

This structured approach ensures clarity, improves collaboration, and provides a solid foundation for AI-assisted coding.

### What Can Riko Do?

üöÄ **Plan Features Systematically** from a simple idea to a full specification.
üîß **Generate Technical Designs** that align perfectly with approved requirements.
üìù **Create Actionable Task Lists** to guide a smooth implementation process.
ü§î **Ensure Code Aligns with Plans** by providing a clear, documented source of truth.
üîÑ **Streamline AI Collaboration** by giving AI assistants the context they need.

### Quick Start

1.  Navigate to the **"Specs"** tab in the Roo sidebar.
2.  Click the **"Create New Spec"** button.
3.  Follow the guided, three-phase workflow to build your feature plan.

---

### Key Features

#### Spec-Driven Workflow
Riko introduces a structured, three-phase process to guide development:
* **Requirements Phase**: Capture user stories and acceptance criteria in the EARS format.
* **Design Phase**: Document system architecture, data models, and API interfaces.
* **Tasks Phase**: Break down the design into a clear, sequential implementation plan.

#### Spec Management Dashboard
A centralized view to manage all your feature specifications. See the status of each spec at a glance, create new specs, and navigate to the editor.

#### Multi-Phase Editor
A guided editor that walks you through each phase of the spec process. The UI is designed to help you focus on the current stage while providing context from previous phases.

#### Seamless Roo Integration
Riko is not a separate tool; it's a native feature module.
* **UI Consistency**: Built using Roo's existing Svelte components and Tailwind CSS design system.
* **Backend Integration**: Natively extends Roo's Express.js backend and uses the same Drizzle ORM and database.
* **Shared Authentication**: Securely uses Roo's existing user authentication and authorization.

### Resources

* **Documentation**: (Coming Soon)
* **Community**: Join the main [Roo Code Discord](link-to-discord) for discussions.
* **GitHub**: Report [issues](https://github.com/aaronmrosenthal/riko/issues) or request [features](https://github.com/aaronmrosenthal/riko/issues).

### Local Setup & Development

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/aaronmrosenthal/riko.git](https://github.com/aaronmrosenthal/riko.git)
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### Run the extension:

There are several ways to run the Riko extension:

**Development Mode (F5)**

For active development, use VSCode's built-in debugging:

1.  Press **F5** (or go to `Run` ‚Üí `Start Debugging`) in VSCode. This will open a new VSCode window with the Riko extension running.
2.  Changes to the webview will appear immediately.
3.  Changes to the core extension will also hot reload automatically.

**Manual VSIX Installation**

If you prefer to install the VSIX package manually:

1.  First, build the VSIX package:
    ```bash
    pnpm vsix
    ```
2.  A `.vsix` file will be generated in the `bin/` directory.
3.  Install it manually using the VSCode CLI:
    ```bash
    code --install-extension bin/riko-cline-<version>.vsix
    ```
