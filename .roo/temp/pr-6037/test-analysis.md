## Test Analysis for PR #6037

### Test Organization

1. **Test File Location**

    - Tests are correctly placed in `src/services/mcp/__tests__/McpHub.spec.ts`
    - New tests are added within the existing "server disabled state" describe block
    - Follows the established pattern of grouping related tests

2. **Test Naming Conventions**
    - Test names follow the pattern: "should [action] when [condition]"
    - Examples:
        - "should not connect to disabled servers during initialization"
        - "should disconnect server when toggling to disabled"
        - "should reconnect server when toggling to enabled"
    - Consistent with existing test naming conventions

### Coverage of Edge Cases

1. **Initialization Scenario**

    - ✅ Tests that disabled servers don't connect during startup
    - ✅ Tests mixed enabled/disabled servers initialization
    - Good coverage of the initialization flow

2. **Toggle Scenarios**

    - ✅ Tests disabling an enabled, connected server
    - ✅ Tests enabling a disabled, disconnected server
    - ✅ Verifies connection/disconnection calls

3. **Missing Edge Cases**
    - ❌ No test for toggling a server that's already in the target state (e.g., disabling an already disabled server)
    - ❌ No test for toggling during connection/disconnection process
    - ❌ No test for error handling during toggle operations

### Mock Usage Patterns

1. **Consistent Mock Setup**

    - Uses the established pattern of mocking `StdioClientTransport` and `Client`
    - Properly mocks `fs.readFile` for configuration
    - Follows the pattern of clearing mocks before tests

2. **Mock Verification**
    - Correctly verifies transport and client method calls
    - Uses `toHaveBeenCalledWith` for precise verification
    - Checks connection array state after operations

### Pattern Consistency

1. **Test Structure**

    - Each test follows the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
    - Mock setup is consistent with other tests in the file
    - Uses `vi.mocked()` consistently for type-safe mocking

2. **Async Handling**
    - Properly uses `async/await` for asynchronous operations
    - Uses `setTimeout` with Promise for initialization timing
    - Consistent with existing async test patterns

### Coverage Assessment

1. **Code Paths Covered**

    - ✅ Disabled check in `updateServerConnections()` for new servers
    - ✅ Disabled check in `updateServerConnections()` for config changes
    - ✅ Disconnection logic in `toggleServerDisabled()`
    - ✅ Reconnection logic in `toggleServerDisabled()`

2. **UI Changes**
    - ❌ No tests for the UI color change in `McpView.tsx`
    - The `getStatusColor()` change is not covered by tests
    - UI tests would need to be in a separate test file

### Recommendations

1. **Add Edge Case Tests**

    - Test toggling to the same state (no-op scenario)
    - Test error handling during toggle operations
    - Test concurrent toggle operations

2. **Add UI Tests**

    - Create tests for `getStatusColor()` logic in `McpView.tsx`
    - Verify the grey color is returned for disabled servers
    - Test interaction between disabled state and connection status

3. **Integration Tests**
    - Consider adding integration tests that verify the full flow
    - Test that UI updates correctly when backend state changes
