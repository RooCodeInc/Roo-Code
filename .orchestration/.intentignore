# .intentignore — Intent Authorization Bypass List
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# List intent IDs that should bypass the UI-blocking authorization gate.
# 
# Intents listed here will have their DESTRUCTIVE operations auto-approved
# (but CRITICAL commands like rm -rf, git push --force still require approval).
#
# A codebase is a collection of intents as much as it is a collection of
# organized code files linked by imports. Some intents may be low-risk
# enough that manual approval for every write is unnecessary.
#
# Format: One intent ID per line. Lines starting with # are comments.
