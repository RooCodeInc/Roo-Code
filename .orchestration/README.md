# Intent-Code Traceability Orchestration Directory

#

# This directory contains the state files for the Intent-Code Traceability system.

# It is managed by the Roo Code hook system and should not be manually edited

# unless you are initializing a new workspace.

# Files in this directory:

# - active_intents.yaml: Business intent specifications

# - agent_trace.jsonl: Append-only ledger of all code changes

# - intent_map.md: Spatial map of intents to files

# - CLAUDE.md: Shared brain for parallel agent sessions

# To initialize a new workspace:

# 1. Create this .orchestration directory

# 2. Create active_intents.yaml with your intent specifications

# 3. The system will automatically create other files as needed
