# Shared Brain — TRP1 Governed Workspace

_Append-only. Machine-managed brain for cross-session knowledge persistence._

## Architectural Decisions

- 2026-02-17: Implementing Intent-Driven Architecture to solve context management bottleneck.
- 2026-02-17: Using SHA-256 content hashing for spatial independence in the Agent Trace spec.

## Lessons Learned

- [SYSTEM_BOOT] Initializing the governance framework. Handshake protocol is NOW ACTIVE.
- [RULE] Protocol Enforcement: Your first action MUST be `select_active_intent(intent_id)`.

## Project Constitution

- All code generated must be accompanied by a semantic trace record.
- Destructive commands MUST be explicitly classification-checked by the Hook Engine.
