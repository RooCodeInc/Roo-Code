## 🔍 **Remaining Issue Analysis**

### **Failing Test: Typing Conflict Resolution**

**Test:** `should resolve typing conflicts with latest-wins strategy`

**Expected Behavior:**

- When same user types on two different devices
- Latest device should win (conflict resolution)
- Only 1 active typer should remain

**Current Behavior:**

- Both devices remain as active typers
- Conflict resolution logic executes but doesn't prevent duplicate states
- Test expects 1 typer, receives 2 typers

**Root Cause:**
The conflict resolution happens after the new typing state is added, but the timing allows both states to coexist. The `resolveTypingConflicts` method clears conflicting states, but the new state is added immediately after, creating a race condition.

**Technical Details:**

```typescript
// Current flow:
1. User-1 starts typing on device-1 ✅
2. User-1 starts typing on device-2 ✅
3. Conflict resolution clears device-1 ✅
4. Device-2 state is added ✅
5. Both states exist simultaneously ❌

// Expected flow:
1. User-1 starts typing on device-1 ✅
2. User-1 starts typing on device-2 ✅
3. Conflict resolution clears device-1 ✅
4. Device-2 state is added ✅
5. Only device-2 state exists ✅
```

## 🔧 **File Management Compliance**

### **Strict No-Proliferation Policy Followed:**

- ✅ **Only 3 files modified:**
  - `typing-indicators.ts` (enhanced conflict resolution)
  - `session-coordinator.ts` (improved error handling)
  - `real-time-communication.test.ts` (maintained existing structure)
- ✅ **Zero new files created** (except this completion report)
- ✅ **Zero utility files added**
- ✅ **Embedded testing approach maintained**

### **Clean File Structure:**

```
