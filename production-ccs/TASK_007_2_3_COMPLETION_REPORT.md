### 4. Database Integration (`src/services/database-websocket-integration.ts`)

- **Real-time Events**: File upload/download event broadcasting
- **WebSocket Integration**: Live progress updates and notifications
- **Database Sync**: File metadata synchronization across devices
- **Event Broadcasting**: Integration with existing event system

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### File Upload Process

1. **Session Initialization**: Client requests upload session with file metadata
2. **Chunk Upload**: File split into chunks and uploaded sequentially
3. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates via WebSocket
4. **Validation**: Security and integrity checks during upload
5. **Finalization**: File assembly and metadata storage
6. **Cleanup**: Temporary file and session cleanup

### File Download Process

1. **Permission Check**: Verify user access rights
2. **Range Support**: HTTP range requests for partial downloads
3. **Streaming**: Efficient file streaming to client
4. **Metrics**: Download tracking and analytics

### Security Features

- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based file access control
- **Validation**: File type and size restrictions
- **Rate Limiting**: Upload/download rate limiting
- **Virus Scanning**: Optional security scanning framework

### Performance Optimizations

- **Chunked Uploads**: Efficient handling of large files
- **Streaming**: Memory-efficient file transfers
- **Caching**: File metadata caching
- **Compression**: Optional file compression support

## 📊 Key Metrics & Performance

### Upload Performance

- **Chunk Size**: 1MB default (configurable)
- **Max File Size**: 100MB per file
- **Concurrent Uploads**: Support for multiple simultaneous uploads
- **Resume Capability**: Failed uploads can be resumed
