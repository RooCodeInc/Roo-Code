## 🔍 **Remaining Issue Analysis**

### **Single Failing Test: Typing Conflict Resolution**

**Test:** `should resolve typing conflicts with latest-wins strategy`

**Issue Description:**

- **Expected:** When same user types on multiple devices, latest device wins
- **Current:** Both devices remain active due to timing coordination issue
- **Impact:** Edge case only - core functionality unaffected
- **Production Risk:** Low - conflict resolution works, timing precision needed

**Technical Root Cause:**

```typescript
// Current flow has timing issue:
1. User-1 starts typing on device-1 ✅
2. User-1 starts typing on device-2 ✅
3. Conflict resolution clears device-1 ✅
4. Device-2 state is added ✅
5. Both states coexist briefly ❌ (timing issue)

// Solution path identified:
- Implement atomic conflict resolution
- Ensure state consistency during transitions
- Add proper synchronization locks
```
