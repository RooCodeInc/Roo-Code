## Issue Content

### Feature Description
Validate the complete PoC implementation by activating the local development version of the Roo Code extension and confirming end-to-end functionality of the remote UI communication system.

### Requirements Reference
- [x] Task Definition: [task-003-poc-validation-extension-activation.md](docs/tasks/task-003-poc-validation-extension-activation.md)
- [x] Development Setup Guide: [development-setup-guide.md](docs/development-setup-guide.md)
- [x] TASK-002 Implementation: Complete foundation with IPC handler and testing framework
- [x] Implementation Plan: Final validation phase of simplified approach

### Background
TASK-002 successfully implemented:
- ✅ Comprehensive testing framework (Phase 1: 100% pass rate)
- ✅ VS Code extension integration with IPC handler
- ✅ Complete documentation and development setup guides

The final step is to activate the extension in development mode and validate the complete mobile-to-desktop communication flow.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Primary Goals
- [ ] **Extension Activation**: Successfully activate local development version with IPC handler
- [ ] **IPC Connection**: Confirm Unix socket creation at `/tmp/app.roo-extension`
- [ ] **Phase 2 Tests**: 100% pass rate for extension integration tests
- [ ] **End-to-End Flow**: Complete mobile browser → VS Code task creation workflow

#### Secondary Goals
- [ ] **Performance Validation**: Confirm acceptable response times and resource usage
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Validate error recovery and fallback mechanisms
- [ ] **Documentation Updates**: Update all reports with final validation results

### Implementation Notes

#### Technical Requirements
- **VS Code**: Latest version with Roo Code extension source
- **Node.js**: 18+ for running tests and CCS server
- **Terminal Access**: For IPC testing and commands
- **Browser**: Modern browser for web interface testing

#### Validation Phases
1. **Development Environment Setup** (30 min) - Activate local extension
2. **IPC Validation** (15 min) - Test socket communication
3. **Automated Test Validation** (15 min) - Run Phase 2 tests
4. **End-to-End Workflow** (30 min) - Test complete flow
5. **Documentation Updates** (30 min) - Update all reports

### Testing Requirements

#### Automated Tests
- [ ] Phase 2 extension integration tests (2/2 expected to pass)
- [ ] IPC connection validation
- [ ] Message protocol testing

#### Manual Testing Scenarios
- [ ] Extension Development Host activation
- [ ] Unix socket creation verification
- [ ] CCS server startup and web interface
- [ ] Complete mobile browser to VS Code workflow
- [ ] Error condition testing

#### Performance Testing
- [ ] IPC response time < 100ms for status requests
- [ ] End-to-end latency < 2 seconds for message processing
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring during Extension Development Host

### Documentation Updates

#### Required Updates
- [ ] Update [TASK_002_FINAL_REPORT.md](poc-remote-ui/results/TASK_002_FINAL_REPORT.md) with validation results
- [ ] Create new TASK_003_COMPLETION_REPORT.md
- [ ] Update [TASK_002_SUMMARY.md](docs/tasks/TASK_002_SUMMARY.md) with final status
- [ ] Update [TASK_002_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md](docs/TASK_002_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md)

#### Evidence Documentation
- [ ] Screenshots of successful tests
- [ ] Performance metrics and timing data
- [ ] Error logs and resolution steps
- [ ] Final validation checklist completion

### Dependencies

#### Prerequisites
- [x] TASK-002 implementation complete
- [x] Development Setup Guide available
- [x] Phase 2 tests implemented and ready
- [x] Extension modifications committed to branch

#### External Dependencies
- VS Code Extension Development Host functionality
- Unix socket support on macOS
- Node.js and npm for test execution
- Modern browser for web interface testing

### Success Metrics

#### Technical Metrics
- **IPC Response Time**: < 100ms for status requests
- **End-to-End Latency**: < 2 seconds for message processing
- **Test Pass Rate**: 100% for all automated tests
- **Error Rate**: 0% for normal operation scenarios

#### Quality Metrics
- **Documentation Accuracy**: All steps work as documented
- **Reproducibility**: Process can be repeated reliably
- **Error Recovery**: System handles failures gracefully
- **User Experience**: Interface is intuitive and responsive

### Risk Assessment

#### Low Risk
- Extension activation (well-documented process with fallbacks)
- IPC testing (simple protocol with clear success/failure indicators)
- Automated tests (already proven to work in isolation)

#### Medium Risk
- End-to-end flow (more complex with multiple components)
- Performance (resource usage in Extension Development Host)
- Browser compatibility (mobile interface responsiveness)

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental validation (test each component separately)
- Fallback options (multiple development setup approaches available)
- Clear troubleshooting guides provided
- Development setup guide covers common issues

### Expected Outcome

Upon successful completion of TASK-003, we will have:

✅ **Fully Validated PoC**: Complete mobile-to-desktop communication working  
✅ **Proven Architecture**: Simplified approach confirmed viable  
✅ **Performance Baseline**: Metrics for future optimization  
✅ **Complete Documentation**: Comprehensive implementation and validation records  
✅ **Foundation for Production**: Solid base for full feature implementation  

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start Extension Development Host
code .  # Then press F5

# Test IPC after activation
ls -la /tmp/app.roo-extension
echo '{"type": "getStatus"}' | nc -U /tmp/app.roo-extension

# Run validation tests
cd poc-remote-ui && node testing/phase2-extension-integration.js

# Test end-to-end flow
cd poc-remote-ui && npm start  # Then open http://localhost:3000
```
